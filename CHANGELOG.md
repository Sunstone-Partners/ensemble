# Changelog

All notable changes to the Ensemble Plugins ecosystem will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [6.9.4] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **core:** the `init-project` constitution template emits Article-style headings (#68).
  Bumps `ensemble-core` 5.6.0 → 5.6.1.
- **development:** `create-trd-foreman` runs the Constitution Gate (#67), and `create-trd`
  makes the gate observable on every run (#69). Bumps `ensemble-development` 6.0.5 → 6.0.6.
- **product:** `create-prd` makes the Constitution Gate observable on every run (#69).
  Bumps `ensemble-product` 5.6.0 → 5.6.1.
- **pi:** generated agents keep an explicitly declared `Task` as native `task`, so OMP
  orchestrators can delegate, without granting delegation to agents that don't declare it (#71).
  Bumps `ensemble-pi` 1.6.9 → 1.6.10.
- **codex:** regenerated `create-prd`, `create-trd` and `create-trd-foreman` skills for the
  changes above. Bumps `ensemble-codex` 5.3.1 → 5.3.2.

### CI

- `dev` is now the integration branch; PRs into `main` must come from `dev` and pass a release
  gate that requires version bumps for changed packages (#82).
- The router's Python suite runs in CI, and fails rather than passing when pytest is missing (#75).

`ensemble-full` 6.9.3 → 6.9.4.

## [6.9.3] - 2026-08-13

### Removed

- **development:** resolve shorthand agent names to installed namespaced plugin agents before Task delegation.

### Fixed

- **core:** close SSE subscribers before `server.close()` in `refinement-review` stop()
  so the server no longer hangs on shutdown when a long-lived session has open
  EventSource clients. Bumps `ensemble-core` 5.5.0 → 5.5.1.
- **development:** include runtime-installed plugin agents (`~/.omp/plugins/node_modules/@*/agents/*.md`)
  in `AGENT_REGISTRY` and `KNOWN_AGENTS`. `configure-team` Phase 3 Step 1 and
  `implement-trd-beads` Preflight Order 11 now scan both the source
  `packages/*/agents/*.yaml` tree and the runtime plugin path, dedupe with the
  runtime entry winning, and rebuild `KNOWN_AGENTS` / `AGENT_ALIAS_MAP` after
  every plugin install. Fixes consumer-repo agent discovery gaps (e.g. foreman's
  local 3-agent registry shadowing the 30-agent OMP install registry).
- **development:** join the `do NOT re-read the file again` line in
  `configure-team.yaml` so the spec-required literal is grep-able as a single
  substring (the rendered prompt is unchanged for the LLM).
- **development:** `applyPhaseFilter` now passes `stacked: prFormat` to
  `selectNextTasks` so prFormat mode implies phase-strict dispatch instead of
  silently falling through to non-stacked behavior.
- **development:** `trd-cli` missing-subcommand error now begins with
  `Missing subcommand. ` so the smoke test assertion matches without losing
  the existing Usage hint.

## [6.9.2] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **development:** preserve verbatim source TRD task markdown in generated workstream tasks so deterministic parsing does not discard semantic detail.

## [6.9.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **development:** decompose workstream TRD acceptance criteria into AC-level implementation, test, and validation tasks.

## [6.9.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **development:** add `beads-scaffold-specialist` for Beads hierarchy/dependency graph scaffolding and repair without product-code implementation.

## [6.8.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **development:** reuse the source PRD micro UUID for generated TRD IDs; workstream TRDs still generate their own micro UUID.

## [6.8.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Use micro UUID document IDs for generated PRD/TRD/workstream artifact filenames to avoid sequence-number collisions across large teams.

## [6.7.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **development:** add `/ensemble:create-workstream-trd` to generate a single executable workstream TRD from multiple source TRDs while preserving provenance.
- **development:** deprecate direct multi-TRD `/ensemble:implement-trd-beads` execution; require generated workstream TRDs by default.

## [6.6.5] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **development:** scaffold explicit AC-* validation and XC-* cross-cutting beads, and enforce Definition of Done gates before bead closure.

## [6.6.4] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **development:** resolve shorthand agent names to installed namespaced plugin agents before Task delegation.

## [6.6.3] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **development:** keep implement-trd-beads running through routine progress milestones; only pause for real user decisions.

## [6.6.2] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **full:** parse TRD scalar frontmatter without requiring installed npm dependencies in plugin cache.

## [6.6.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **full:** bundle TRD CLI helper modules required by installed Beads/TRD commands.

## [6.6.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **development:** add multi-TRD workstream support
- **development:** add refine-beads command

### Changed

- **TRD:** sync refine-beads checkboxes
- add refine-beads TRD
- archive completed PRDs
- document multi-TRD workstreams
- update multi-TRD workstream TRD
- stop tracking beads issue database

### Fixed

- **development:** address coderabbit findings

## [5.12.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Pi runtime** (`ensemble-pi`): Translation-layer runtime for Ensemble commands, with skill-copier and CRLF normalization (#55).
- **Codex package** (`ensemble-codex`): Codex release notes generation and project installation scripts.
- **Standards discovery**: `/ensemble:discover-standards` and `/ensemble:inject-standards` commands for extracting and applying coding conventions.
- **Implement-bead command**: Single-bead implementation workflow (`/ensemble:implement-bead`).
- **Feature pipeline**: `/ensemble:feature` orchestration command combining PRD → TRD → implementation (#53).
- **Requirement traceability**: End-to-end `validate-requirements` and `requirement-status` commands (#52).
- **Auto-team configuration**: Automated team config generation from TRD complexity analysis (TRD-AUTOTEAM-001).
- **Beads-plan and beads-build**: Commands for bead hierarchy analysis and builder/code-review/close pipeline.
- **Team-based execution model** for `implement-trd-beads`: Team YAML parser, state machine, parallel builders, QA delegation, rejection loops, metrics, and quality gates.
- **Session logging**: `/ensemble:sessionlog` command with sensitive data exclusion and incremental logging.
- **OpenCode support**: Full translation layer for OpenCode runtime — SkillCopier, CommandTranslator, AgentTranslator, HookBridge, ManifestGenerator, and distribution packaging.

### Changed

- **PRD/TRD commands rewritten**: Competitive analysis rewrite of `fold-prompt`, `create-prd`, `create-trd` with interview-style elicitation.
- **Refine commands**: Added readiness gates to `refine-prd` and `refine-trd`.
- **Git workflow**: Consolidated on git-town, removed jj-vcs skill.
- **implement-trd-beads**: Migrated from bd to br/bv with wheel instructions, added PRD/TRD file links to bead task descriptions.
- **Model aliases**: Simplified — removed opus-4-6 and sonnet-4 aliases.
- Command frontmatter now includes version, category, and last-updated fields.

### Fixed

- Pi runtime: `sourceRoot` derived from `__dirname` instead of `process.cwd()`.
- Pi skill-copier: CRLF → LF normalization to prevent CI drift.
- implement-trd-beads: Corrected backwards dependency wiring in scaffold.
- create-trd: Addressed code review findings M-1 and M-2.
- version-manager: Widened commit message character allowlist.

### Removed

- `agent-progress-pane` and `task-progress-pane` packages (consolidated).

## [5.3.0] - 2026-02-17

## [3.6.5]

### Changed

- Last release before the v4 plugin architecture migration.
- See the v3.x branch for the pre-plugin changelog history.
