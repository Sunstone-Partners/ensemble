# Environment Variables Reference

This document lists every environment variable recognized by Ensemble — what each one does, its default value, and a usage example. Variables are grouped by who sets them.

## User-Facing Variables

Set these in your shell before invoking Ensemble commands. None are required unless you need to override a default.

| Variable | Default | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.config` | Base directory for user-level config. Ensemble looks for its config at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ensemble/`. Standard XDG variable shared with other tools. | `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/opt/config` |
| `ENSEMBLE_PERMITTER_DISABLE` | _(unset)_ | Disable the permission-expansion hook entirely. Set to any non-empty value (e.g., `1`). Useful when troubleshooting permission issues or when the hook conflicts with other tooling. | `ENSEMBLE_PERMITTER_DISABLE=1` |
| `PERMITTER_DEBUG` | _(unset)_ | Enable verbose debug logging from the permitter hook to stderr. Set to `1`. Shows detailed permission-matching info for each tool invocation. | `PERMITTER_DEBUG=1` |
| `ENSEMBLE_PANE_DISABLE` | _(unset)_ | Disable the pane-spawner hook. Set to any non-empty value. Prevents Ensemble from auto-opening terminal panes in WezTerm, Zellij, or tmux during agent execution. | `ENSEMBLE_PANE_DISABLE=1` |
| `METRICS_API_URL` | `http://localhost:3002/api/v1` | Endpoint for posting usage and metrics events. Only needed when using the metrics plugin. | `METRICS_API_URL=https://metrics.example.com/api/v1` |
| `METRICS_API_TOKEN` | _(none)_ | Bearer token for the metrics API. When set, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Only needed when the metrics endpoint requires authentication. | `METRICS_API_TOKEN=secret-token` |
| `PROJECT_ID` | Current directory basename | Project identifier tag attached to all metric events. Defaults to the basename of the current working directory. | `PROJECT_ID=my-project` |
| `ENSEMBLE_USE_STACKED_PRS` | _(unset — single PR)_ | When `true`, `implement-trd` and `implement-trd-beads` create one stacked PR per `### PR N:` / sprint section (git-town append chain). When unset or any other value, all phases are implemented on a single branch and ONE PR is created for the whole TRD. Phase ordering is preserved either way. | `ENSEMBLE_USE_STACKED_PRS=true` then run `/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/my-trd.md` |
| `ENSEMBLE_BRANCHING_STRATEGY` | _(unset — auto-detect)_ | Overrides Preflight's auto-detected branching strategy for `implement-trd`, `implement-trd-beads`, and `beads-build`. `git-town` forces git-town (HALTs with instructions if git-town isn't installed or configured). `plain-git` forces plain git commands (`git checkout -b`/`git switch`/`git push`), skipping git-town entirely regardless of its state. When unset, Preflight auto-detects: uses `git-town` if installed and configured; otherwise falls back to `plain-git` (silently if git-town isn't installed, with one warning if it's installed but unconfigured). | `ENSEMBLE_BRANCHING_STRATEGY=plain-git` then run `/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/my-trd.md` |
| `ENSEMBLE_PR_BACKEND` | _(unset — auto-detect, defaults to `gh`)_ | Controls how PRs are created, independent of `ENSEMBLE_BRANCHING_STRATEGY`. `gh` uses the GitHub CLI (today's default behavior). `ado` targets Azure DevOps. `manual` skips automated PR creation and prints instructions instead. When unset and the origin remote is on a host git-town can't support natively (e.g. `dev.azure.com`), Preflight prompts interactively or HALTs (non-interactive sessions) asking you to set this variable. | `ENSEMBLE_PR_BACKEND=ado` then run `/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/my-trd.md` |
| `CLOUDFLARED_PATH` | Auto-detect (`~/.cloudflared/cloudflared`, `/usr/local/bin/cloudflared`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/cloudflared`, `/usr/bin/cloudflared`, then `PATH` lookup) | Absolute path to the `cloudflared` binary used by `--tunnel=quick` to expose the refinement-review server over a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel. Set this if `cloudflared` is installed in a non-standard location. | `CLOUDFLARED_PATH=/opt/local/bin/cloudflared` |

## Injected by Claude Code

Claude Code sets these automatically when a plugin loads or when a hook is invoked. Do not set them manually — their values are managed by the runtime.

| Variable | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | Absolute path to the installed plugin directory. Used in all hook `command` fields to locate hook scripts. | Referenced as `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/router.py` in `hooks.json`. |
| `TOOL_NAME` | Name of the tool being invoked (e.g., `Bash`, `Read`, `Task`). | Injected into every hook process at invocation time. |
| `TOOL_INPUT` | JSON-encoded parameters for the current tool call. | Parse with `JSON.parse(process.env.TOOL_INPUT \|\| '{}')` inside hook scripts. |
| `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` | Claude Code session identifier. | Read by the metrics hook to tag events with the originating session. |

## Auto-Detected (read only)

Ensemble reads these standard variables from the environment to detect the active terminal multiplexer, shell, and runtime context. Ensemble never sets or modifies them.

| Variable | Detected Context |
|---|---|
| `TMUX` / `TMUX_PANE` | Active tmux session |
| `WEZTERM_PANE` | WezTerm terminal |
| `ZELLIJ` / `ZELLIJ_PANE_ID` / `ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME` | Zellij terminal multiplexer |
| `SHELL` | Current shell, used for framework and environment detection hints |
| `GIT_BRANCH` / `GIT_COMMIT` | Read by the metrics hook as event tags |
| `USER` / `USERNAME` | Read by the metrics hook for event identity |
| `NODE_ENV` | Standard Node environment flag, read by the metrics hook |
