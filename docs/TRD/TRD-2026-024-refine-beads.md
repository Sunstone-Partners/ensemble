# TRD-2026-024: refine-beads Command

## Document Overview

This TRD translates `PRD-2026-024` into a brownfield implementation plan for adding `/ensemble:refine-beads`: an approval-gated Beads graph refinement command. The command inspects a selected epic/release-train subtree or explicit project scope, finds dependency/hierarchy/traceability/PR-boundary gaps, proposes safe `br` repair commands, asks for approval, applies only approved fixes, verifies each mutation, syncs Beads, and revalidates with `bv --robot-*`.

**MCP enhancement:** skipped. No MCP tools were detected in the current tool surface.

## Architecture Decision

### Selected Approach: Option C — Balanced Brownfield Extraction

Add `packages/development/commands/refine-beads.yaml` as command orchestrator and extract deterministic graph/finding/repair logic into focused Node helpers under `packages/development/lib/`. Generated command output will live at `packages/development/commands/ensemble/refine-beads.md`.

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Summary | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|---------|------|------|----------|
| A: Command-prose only | Put all logic in `refine-beads.yaml` | Fastest, fewest files | Hard to unit test; brittle parsing; high regression risk | Rejected |
| B: Full JS engine | Move full workflow, prompts, br/bv execution, and repair application into JS | Strongest boundaries; most reusable | Larger upfront build; duplicates command-orchestration conventions | Rejected for MVP |
| C: Balanced brownfield | YAML orchestrates tool calls/prompts; JS helpers compute scope, findings, repairs, verification checks | Testable; small surface area; matches existing multi-TRD helper pattern | Requires clean command/helper contract | Selected |

### Rationale

Existing development commands already use small JS helpers for deterministic parsing and planning while leaving user-facing orchestration in YAML. `refine-beads` has enough graph and repair logic to require tests, but not enough to justify a full workflow runtime. Option C keeps mutation safety visible in the command and makes the risky logic pure/testable.

## Error Handling and Safety Rules

- Analysis phase is read-only: no `br update`, `br dep add`, `br dep remove`, `br close`, branch, test, builder, reviewer, or implementation command.
- `br sync --flush-only` is allowed before/after analysis and repair.
- Bare `bv` is forbidden. Use only `bv --robot-insights`, `bv --robot-plan`, `bv --robot-alerts`, or `bv --robot-suggest`.
- Dependency mutations require explicit confirmation even when the user approves `all` fixes.
- Cycles and contradictory recommendations require user-selected resolution; never guess.
- Repairs execute one command at a time, with verification before continuing.
- On failure, stop further fixes and offer retry, skip, inverse commands, cancel remaining, or abort.
- Final output always includes findings/fixes/failures/remaining risks and suggests `/ensemble:beads-plan` or `/ensemble:beads-build`.

## Adversarial Review

### Architecture Issues and Resolutions

1. **Issue:** `br`/`bv` output formats may diverge or omit graph facts needed for a unified view.  
   **Resolution:** Normalize all external outputs into explicit graph records and keep raw source references in findings for debugging.

2. **Issue:** A pure command-prose apply loop could silently continue after partial failure.  
   **Resolution:** The TRD requires one-command-at-a-time execution, verification before continuation, and a hard prompt on failure.

3. **Issue:** Duplicate detection can generate false positives.  
   **Resolution:** Duplicate findings never auto-close. They only propose user review options: merge, close, relink, or leave unchanged.

### Coverage Issues and Resolutions

1. **Issue:** Project-wide mode could produce findings unrelated to the user's intended workstream.  
   **Resolution:** Project mode requires an explicit warning and each finding includes affected epic/release-train context where possible.

2. **Issue:** The command could be mistaken for an implementation command because it edits Beads.  
   **Resolution:** Requirements and tasks explicitly forbid builders, tests, branches, PR creation, implementation loops, and task execution.

### Dependency and Estimate Issues

1. **Issue:** Finding detection and repair planning are tightly coupled.  
   **Resolution:** PR 2 ships read-only findings first; PR 3 converts findings to repair plans later, preserving a testable boundary.

2. **Issue:** Recovery behavior is safety-critical and difficult to unit test end-to-end.  
   **Resolution:** Command contract tests verify prompt options/order, while helper tests verify deterministic inverse/verification data.

### Testability Issues

1. **Issue:** User prompt paths are interactive.  
   **Resolution:** Test command text contracts and pure helper outputs; use fixtures for approval selections where CLI bridge supports JSON.

2. **Issue:** `br`/`bv` integration can be environment-specific.  
   **Resolution:** Unit tests use normalized fixture data; command validation checks text and generated command output.

## Design Readiness Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Architecture completeness | 4.8 | Components, data contracts, safety boundaries, and external tool responsibilities are defined. |
| Task coverage | 4.8 | Every PRD requirement has implementation and test coverage in traceability matrix. |
| Dependency clarity | 4.7 | PR boundaries are acyclic and sequence from read-only analysis to planning, apply, and validation. |
| Estimate confidence | 4.7 | Tasks are granular; most implementation tasks are 2-3h with paired tests. |
| **Overall** | **4.75** | **PASS — ready for implementation handoff after approval.** |

## Next Steps

After approval, implement with:

```bash
/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/TRD-2026-024-refine-beads.md --plan
```

Then execute when the generated Beads graph is reviewed:

```bash
/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/TRD-2026-024-refine-beads.md --execute
```
