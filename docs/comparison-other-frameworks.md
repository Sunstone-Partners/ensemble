## Framework Profiles

### Ensemble (Sunstone Partners, v5.0.0)

**Philosophy:** Full-lifecycle orchestration platform with a specialized agent mesh.

Ensemble is a Claude Code plugin ecosystem organized into 4 tiers across 24 npm packages. It provides 38 specialized agents (backend-developer, frontend-developer, code-reviewer, qa-orchestrator, etc.) orchestrated through YAML-defined workflow commands. The primary pipeline: `create-prd` → `refine-prd` → `create-trd` → `refine-trd` → `implement-trd-beads`, driven by persistent beads (`br`/`bv`) task management with cross-session resumability.

Key architectural elements:
- **Plugin tiers:** Core (ensemble-core) → Workflow (product, development, quality, infrastructure) → Framework Skills (React, NestJS, Rails, Phoenix, Blazor) → Test Frameworks (Jest, Pytest, RSpec, xUnit, ExUnit)
- **Agent mesh:** 38 specialized agents with 6 orchestrators; delegation via `Task()` tool with alias resolution (`@backend-developer` → `ensemble-full:backend-developer`)
- **Task persistence:** beads (`br`/`bv`) provides a real SQLite + JSONL persistence layer with dependency graphs, PageRank triage, and cross-session resumability
- **Runtimes:** Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, OMP via direct support and compatibility layers
- **Foreman dispatch:** `--foreman` flag enables fully automated orchestration pipelines
- **Collaborative review:** `--collab` mode renders PRD/TRD refinement in a browser sidebar with per-line comments

### Spec-Kit (GitHub, github.com/github/spec-kit)

**Philosophy:** Extensible, intent-driven harness that guides AI coding agents across the SDLC via Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

Spec-Kit is a Python CLI (`specify`) that drops Markdown commands into an AI agent's commands directory. The core SDD process ships ready to use: **Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement**. Each phase produces a Markdown artifact that feeds the next. Supports 30+ AI coding agents (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex CLI, etc.) — an unusually broad compatibility matrix. No plugin ecosystem; framework-agnostic by design.

Key architectural elements:
- **Core commands:** `constitution` (immutable project principles) → `specify` (detailed spec) → `plan` (architecture) → `tasks` (implementation checklist) → `implement` (sequential execution)
- **Multi-agent model:** Orchestrator (state machine) + PM agent (clarification, prioritization) + Developer agent (SPEC.md, PLAN.md, TASKS.md artifacts)
- **Constitution:** High-level immutable principles enforced as phase gates across all commands
- **Workflows:** Multi-step, resumable YAML automation pipelines with human review gates
- **Presets:** Stackable template overrides with priority-based resolution (e.g., healthcare-compliance preset)
- **Runtimes:** 30+ agents — CLI and IDE-based (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Amp, Codex CLI, Roo Code, Kilo Code, Qwen Code, opencode, etc.)
- **Artifacts:** `SPEC.md` (requirements + ACs), `PLAN.md` (architecture, API contracts, data model), `TASKS.md` (executable checklist), standalone `research.md` and `data-model.md`

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Orchestration Model

**Ensemble** uses a YAML-defined workflow command system where each command (`create-prd`, `implement-trd-beads`, etc.) is a declarative specification of phases, steps, actions, and constraints. Commands orchestrate sub-agents via the `Task()` tool, with an agent alias resolution layer (`AGENT_ALIAS_MAP`) that maps shorthand names to installed plugin identifiers. The Foreman runtime provides fully automated dispatch pipelines with artifact contracts and hard/soft HALT gates.

**Spec-Kit** uses a state machine orchestrator that drives a PM agent and a developer agent through the SDD phases. The PM agent handles clarification interviews and prioritization; the developer agent produces three intermediate artifacts (SPEC.md, PLAN.md, TASKS.md) before code generation. Workflows are defined in YAML and support pausing at human review gates.

**Assessment:** Ensemble's approach is more structured for complex multi-agent coordination but requires understanding the YAML command schema. Spec-Kit's state machine is simpler for straightforward use cases but less powerful for complex dependency management.

### 2. Requirement Traceability

**Ensemble** provides the strongest traceability in this comparison. Every TRD task carries `[satisfies REQ-NNN]` annotations linking back to PRD requirements. Paired `-TEST` tasks verify requirements at runtime. Closure comments write `req-satisfied:REQ-NNN ac-proven:AC-NNN-M` tokens into bead history. A satisfaction report is generated at completion. The `bv --robot-*` tools compute PageRank, betweenness, and critical path on the dependency graph.

**Spec-Kit** links tasks to spec requirements by document position — there are no ID-based chains. The `/speckit.analyze` command checks coverage and consistency but cannot query a dependency graph.

**Assessment:** For compliance-heavy or audit-intensive environments, Ensemble's ID-based traceability is a significant advantage.

### 3. Task Persistence and Cross-Session Resumability

**Ensemble's** beads integration (`br`/`bv`) provides a persistent task database that survives session interruptions. `--status` shows in-flight task state; `--reset-task TRD-XXX` recovers failed tasks; structured status comments record the full audit trail. The `br sync --flush-only` command exports SQLite state to JSONL for git tracking.

**Spec-Kit** uses Markdown checkboxes for task state. When the session ends, progress is lost unless manually transcribed.

**Assessment:** Ensemble is far superior for long-running implementations or teams working across time zones. Spec-Kit is acceptable for short, single-session feature implementations.

### 4. Multi-Agent and Team Coordination

**Ensemble** auto-detects complexity and generates a YAML team configuration. `implement-trd-beads` drives a role-based state machine: `open → in_progress → in_design → in_review → in_advisory → in_qa → closed`, with rejection loops back to the builder. Six specialized orchestrators (ensemble, tech-lead, product-management, QA, infrastructure, deployment) coordinate across domains. Concurrent execution via `bv --robot-plan` partitions tracks and dispatches them in parallel.

**Spec-Kit** operates with a single developer agent (guided by a PM agent for clarification). No builder/reviewer/QA chain, no parallel execution, no team mode.

**Assessment:** Ensemble is purpose-built for team-based execution. Spec-Kit is designed for a solo developer or a team using shared-agent patterns (one human reviewing what one AI produces).

### 5. Framework Awareness

**Ensemble** ships dedicated plugins for React, NestJS, Rails, Phoenix, Blazor, Jest, Pytest, RSpec, xUnit, and ExUnit. Framework detection is automatic based on project files. These are not just skill injections — they include command definitions, agent configurations, and testing patterns specific to each framework.

**Spec-Kit** is deliberately framework-agnostic. It provides no framework-specific guidance and makes no attempt to detect or adapt to the tech stack.

**Assessment:** For organizations with specific framework requirements, Ensemble's baked-in expertise reduces setup time. For greenfield or polyglot projects, Spec-Kit's agnosticism is an advantage.

### 6. Operational Breadth

**Ensemble** includes: conventional commits enforcement, git-town workflow management, release orchestration, CI/CD infrastructure templates, productivity metrics dashboard, E2E testing with Playwright, security scanning (OWASP-aware), and MCP server integration. These are entirely out of scope for Spec-Kit.

**Spec-Kit** focuses exclusively on the spec-first development cycle. Infrastructure, testing, and release concerns are the team's responsibility.

**Assessment:** Ensemble provides a more complete development lifecycle. Spec-Kit's narrow scope makes it lighter but requires the team to compose additional tooling.

### 7. Constitutional Governance

**Spec-Kit's** `/speckit.constitution` produces a `memory/constitution.md` with Nine Articles (library-first, anti-abstraction gates, simplicity gates, etc.) that every subsequent command enforces as phase gates. This is a powerful mechanism for encoding team standards as technical constraints rather than advisory prompts.

**Ensemble** provides `/init-project`, which generates `docs/standards/constitution.md` with project guardrails, coverage targets, approval requirements, and tech stack detection. The constitution is enforced as a *hard gate* during `create-prd` and `create-trd`: violations halt the phase and block completion with no override path. This matches Spec-Kit's Nine Articles rigor.

**Assessment:** Both enforce constitution as hard phase gates. Spec-Kit's Nine Articles block spec/plan generation with no override. Ensemble's constitution (created via `/init-project`) halts `create-prd`/`create-trd` with no override. For organizations requiring immutable governance, both are now equivalent.

### 8. Runtime Compatibility

**Spec-Kit** supports 30+ AI coding agents — the broadest compatibility in this comparison. This is critical for organizations with heterogeneous tooling or those migrating between agents.

**Ensemble** supports Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and OMP — five runtimes providing direct support and compatibility layers. This is significantly broader than initially documented, making Ensemble far more flexible than the prior analysis indicated. However, Spec-Kit still maintains a broader compatibility advantage (30+ agents).

**Assessment:** While Ensemble's 5-runtime support is more substantial than initially analyzed, Spec-Kit's 30+ agent integrations remain a decisive advantage for organizations requiring true multi-agent flexibility or migration paths across diverse tooling ecosystems. For teams standardized within Ensemble's 5 supported runtimes (especially Claude Code–focused organizations), Ensemble's specialized orchestration, persistent task state, and deep traceability provide superior capabilities.

### 9. Dependency and Setup Complexity

**Ensemble** requires:
- Node.js ecosystem
- `br` (beads_rust) binary — separate GitHub repository
- `bv` (beads_viewer) binary — separate GitHub repository
- Claude Code installation
- Optional: Foreman server for automated dispatch

**Spec-Kit** requires:
- Python with `uv` (mainstream package manager)
- Any supported AI agent CLI

**Assessment:** Ensemble's setup is significantly more complex. Spec-Kit can be installed and running in minutes. The beads binary dependency is the most friction-generating aspect of Ensemble's onboarding.

## Migration Considerations

### Moving from Spec-Kit to Ensemble

- **Install:** `claude --plugin marketplace add Sunstone-Partners/ensemble`
- **Install beads:** `cargo install beads_rust beads_viewer` (or use nix/homebrew)
- **Migrate specs:** Convert SPEC.md/PROPLAN.md/TASKS.md artifacts to PRD/TRD format; assign REQ-NNN IDs
- **Migrate state:** Transcribe Markdown checkboxes to `br` bead hierarchy
- **New commands:** Use `create-prd` instead of `specify`; `implement-trd-beads` instead of `implement`
- **Lost in migration:** Multi-runtime support, community extensions, presets

### Moving from Ensemble to Spec-Kit

- **Install:** `pip install spec-kit` or `uv tool install spec-kit`
- **Migrate specs:** Convert PRD/TRD to SPEC.md/PROPLAN.md/TASKS.md
- **Migrate state:** Implement-trd-beads tasks → Markdown TASKS.md checkboxes
- **New commands:** Use `specify` instead of `create-prd`; sequential `implement` instead of `implement-trd-beads`
- **Lost in migration:** Beads persistence, parallel execution, requirement IDs, framework skills, team orchestration

## Opportunities for Ensemble

Ensemble already implements most capabilities. Genuine opportunities to increase competitive parity with Spec-Kit:

| Priority | Opportunity | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| High | **Hard-enforce constitution in spec/plan phases** | Constitution violations during `create-prd` and `create-trd` now block phase completion with no override — matching Spec-Kit's Nine Articles rigor | **Implemented (PR #59)** |
| High | **Standalone `research.md` and `data-model.md`** | `create-trd` generates standalone companion artifacts when database or research domains are detected; linked from TRD body | **Implemented (PR #60)** |
| Medium | **Multi-AI-agent support** | Generate command files for Gemini/Copilot/Cursor from same YAML source via `npm run generate` | Gap |
| Medium | **Community plugin catalog** | Open submission mechanism beyond Sunstone-authored plugins | Gap |
| Low | **`quickstart.md` validation artifact** | `implement-trd` generates quickstart.md smoke-test runbook from TRD acceptance criteria; implement-trd-beads routes to implement-trd for v1 | **Implemented (PR #61)** |

### Already Implemented (no action needed)

*Verified by reading actual command YAML definitions and workflow specifications.*

These capabilities were proposed as opportunities but already exist in Ensemble:

- ✓ **Hard-gate constitution enforcement** — `create-prd` and `create-trd` now hard-HALT on constitution violations with no override path (PR #59)
- ✓ **Standalone `research.md` and `data-model.md`** — `create-trd` generates companion artifacts when database or research domains are detected (PR #60)
- ✓ **Quickstart validation artifact** — `implement-trd` generates `quickstart.md` smoke-test runbook from acceptance criteria after completion verification; `implement-trd-beads` routes to `implement-trd` for v1 (PR #61)
- ✓ **Quick-fix workflow** — `ensemble:fix-issue` for lightweight bug fixes (no PRD/TRD overhead)
- ✓ **Cross-artifact requirement analysis** — `ensemble:analyze-requirements` validates PRD↔TRD↔beads alignment
- ✓ **Clarification enforcement** — `ensemble:refine-prd`, `refine-trd`, `refine-prd --from-meeting` surface ambiguities
- ✓ **Feature branching & stacked PRs** — `ensemble:implement-trd` (git-town workflow) and `ensemble:implement-trd-beads` (--branch option, stacked PR support)

## Methodology: Verification of Claims

All numeric and capability claims in this document have been verified against authoritative sources:

- **Ensemble agent count (38):** Verified via direct file count of `packages/*/agents/*.md` files in the repository
- **Ensemble command inventory (43):** Verified via explicit enumeration of YAML files in `packages/*/commands/`
- **Command capabilities:** Claims about command behavior verified by reading actual command YAML descriptions (`description:` field) and workflow definitions, not inferred from filename or keyword matching
- **Spec-Kit claims (30+ agents):** Retained as stated in official Spec-Kit documentation
- **BMAD agent count:** Removed unverifiable claims; Spec-Kit comparison uses only verifiable information

**False positives removed during audit:**
- `configure-team`: Does NOT provide named governance presets; performs auto-sizing by task count
- `manager-dashboard`: Does NOT provide beads dependency visualization; shows git/test/sprint metrics  
- `create-prd`: Does NOT support branching (create-prd has zero branching code); feature branching is provided by `implement-trd` and `implement-trd-beads`

**Lessons learned:** Keyword substring matching on command names is insufficient for capability verification. Each claim requires reading the actual command description and workflow definition.
