/**
 * Unit tests for TRD-007 / TRD-007-TEST (REQ-009): de-advertisement and
 * discoverability convergence for `/ensemble:new-feature` behind the
 * canonical front door `/ensemble:feature`.
 *
 * `ensemble:new-feature` remains fully functional -- it's `ensemble:feature`'s
 * own internal implementation (see feature.yaml's mission summary) -- but is
 * no longer advertised as a top-level entry point in product documentation,
 * and a natural-language "start a new feature" request should converge on
 * the same canonical name both commands already agree on.
