Development agents for frontend/backend implementation

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install @sunstone-partners/ensemble-development
```

## Description

Part of the ensemble plugin ecosystem for Claude Code. This plugin provides development agents for frontend/backend implementation.

## Features

- TBD (to be populated during plugin extraction)

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ensemble:implement-trd` | Complete TRD implementation using git-town workflow with TDD methodology |
| `/ensemble:implement-trd-beads` | TRD implementation with persistent beads project management — epic/story/task hierarchy, `bd ready` execution loop, cross-session resumability |
| `/ensemble:refine-beads` | Approval-gated Beads graph refinement before execution — detects dependency, hierarchy, PR-boundary, traceability, and duplicate-task gaps; applies approved `br` repairs and revalidates with `bv --robot-*` |
| `/ensemble:create-trd` | Create a Technical Requirements Document from a PRD |
| `/ensemble:create-trd-foreman` | Create a Foreman-native structured TRD that `foreman sling prd` can consume |
| `/ensemble:refine-trd` | Refine and improve an existing TRD |
| `/ensemble:fix-issue` | Lightweight bug fix workflow (analysis to PR) |
| `/ensemble:generate-api-docs` | Generate API documentation |

## Usage

After installation, this plugin's agents, commands, and skills will be automatically available in Claude Code.

### Quickstart Validation Artifacts

Standard `/ensemble:implement-trd` generates a parser-backed `quickstart.md` validation runbook after completion verification passes and before final success reporting. The runbook maps parsed TRD acceptance criteria to manual checkbox scenarios and reports parsed AC count, scenario count, unmapped AC count, clarification count, and coverage percentage.

In Foreman mode, the generated `quickstart.md` path and coverage summary are included in the Foreman phase report; when `FOREMAN_ARTIFACT_PATH` is set, the default quickstart path is beside that exact phase artifact. Outside Foreman, the default quickstart path is beside the source TRD unless an explicit output path is supplied.

`/ensemble:implement-trd-beads` does not generate quickstart artifacts in v1. Use standard `/ensemble:implement-trd` when a v1 `quickstart.md` validation artifact is required.

### Multi-TRD Beads Workstreams

`/ensemble:implement-trd-beads` supports both single-TRD and multi-TRD execution.
Single-TRD invocation keeps the existing behavior:

```bash
# Plan/scaffold — branch intent resolved automatically from TRD slug or explicit flag
/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/TRD-2026-001-feature.md --plan --use-current-branch

# Execute an existing scaffold
/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/TRD-2026-001-feature.md --execute --use-current-branch
```

Passing two or more TRD paths activates combined workstream mode:

```bash
# Plan/scaffold
/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/TRD-2026-001-api.md docs/TRD/TRD-2026-002-ui.md --plan --use-current-branch

# Execute
/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/TRD-2026-001-api.md docs/TRD/TRD-2026-002-ui.md --execute --use-current-branch

# Inspect status
/ensemble:implement-trd-beads docs/TRD/TRD-2026-001-api.md docs/TRD/TRD-2026-002-ui.md --status
```

> **Note:** `--branch=<name>` and `--use-current-branch` are mutually exclusive. `--branch=<name>` requires the branch to already exist (switches to it with `git switch`); `--use-current-branch` works on the currently checked-out branch. When neither flag is provided, the workflow (1) auto-detects a matching local branch by TRD slug, (2) reads saved branch intent from the TRD's frontmatter (`ensemble_implement_trd_beads: {branch_name, use_proposed, stacked_prs}`) if auto-detect found no single match, then (3) falls back to pr-plan's proposed branch. Priority: explicit flags > auto-detect > saved frontmatter > pr-plan. If exactly one local branch matches the slug, it is reused automatically. If multiple local branches match, a warning is printed and the workflow falls through to saved-frontmatter or normal branch-intent handling. Saved choices are written back to the TRD frontmatter after confirmation, so subsequent runs on the same TRD reuse the same branch and PR topology without re-prompting. CLI flags (`--branch`, `--use-current-branch`, `ENSEMBLE_USE_STACKED_PRS`) always override all other sources.

Combined workstream mode:

- validates all TRDs before any Beads, branch, or scaffold side effect;
- creates one release train bead plus one TRD epic per source TRD;
- preserves each TRD's PR/story/task hierarchy under its own epic;
- supports source-qualified cross-TRD deps: `<trd-slug>#TRD-NNN` and `<trd-slug>#PR-N`;
- uses only `bv --robot-*` graph checks and prompts before unresolved/cyclic dependency changes;
- reports release train progress plus per-TRD ready/blocked/in-progress counts.

If stacked PR support is enabled with `ENSEMBLE_USE_STACKED_PRS=true`, combined mode prints `Combined workstream mode: stacked PRs enabled`; otherwise it offers scaffold-only or alternate execution paths.

### Refine Beads Graphs

Use `/ensemble:refine-beads` before execution when a Beads scaffold needs graph cleanup:

```bash
/ensemble:refine-beads ensemble-abc1
/ensemble:refine-beads trd-2026-024-refine-beads
/ensemble:refine-beads --scope project
```

The command:

- runs read-only analysis before any mutation;
- uses `br` for all approved updates;
- uses only `bv --robot-*` graph analysis, never bare interactive `bv`;
- reports cycles, orphan tasks, stale/missing blockers, PR-boundary gaps, missing requirement/AC traceability, duplicates, and priority/order mismatches;
- requires explicit user approval before applying fixes;
- requires separate confirmation for dependency updates;
- verifies each `br` command before continuing;
- stops on failure and offers retry, skip, inverse commands, cancel remaining, or abort;
- never starts builders, tests, branches, commits, PRs, or implementation loops.

After refinement, continue with `/ensemble:beads-plan` or `/ensemble:beads-build`.
