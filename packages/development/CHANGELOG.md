# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [6.9.2] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Preserve verbatim source TRD task markdown in generated workstream tasks so deterministic parsing does not discard semantic detail.

## [6.9.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Decompose workstream TRD acceptance criteria into AC-level implementation, test, and validation tasks.

## [6.9.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Add `beads-scaffold-specialist` for Beads hierarchy/dependency graph scaffolding and repair without product-code implementation.

## [6.8.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Reuse the source PRD micro UUID for generated TRD IDs; workstream TRDs still generate their own micro UUID.

## [5.10.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Use micro UUID document IDs for generated TRD/workstream artifact filenames instead of sequence numbers.

## [5.9.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Added `/ensemble:create-workstream-trd` for generating a single executable workstream TRD from multiple source TRDs while preserving provenance.
- Deprecated direct multi-TRD `/ensemble:implement-trd-beads` execution in favor of generated workstream TRDs.

### Added

- `implement-trd-beads` combined workstream mode for multiple TRD paths.
  - Plans one release train bead and one TRD epic per source TRD.
  - Preserves each TRD-local PR/story/task hierarchy.
  - Supports source-qualified cross-TRD dependencies: `<trd-slug>#TRD-NNN` and `<trd-slug>#PR-N`.
  - Adds `validate-workstream`, `workstream-plan`, and `workstream-status` TRD CLI helpers.
  - Uses `bv --robot-*` validation for graph checks and prompts on ambiguous/cyclic dependency changes.
- `refine-beads` command for approval-gated Beads graph refinement before execution.
  - Detects dependency graph, hierarchy, PR-boundary, traceability, duplicate-task, and priority/order issues.
  - Proposes ordered `br` repair plans and verifies each approved mutation.
  - Requires explicit dependency confirmation and user resolution for cycles/contradictions.
  - Revalidates with `bv --robot-*` and never starts implementation work.

- Plugin extraction and population (in progress)

## [5.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- `implement-trd-beads` command: TRD implementation with persistent beads project management layer
  - Scaffolds epic → story → task bead hierarchy before any implementation begins
  - Drives execution order through `bd ready --parent <EPIC_ID>` rather than TRD re-parsing
  - Cross-session resumability via `--external-ref` idempotency (no `.trd-state/` files)
  - Parallel execution up to configurable limit with file-conflict detection
  - Phase quality gates recorded as bead comments via `bd comments add`
  - TRD checkbox sync to bead closure state on completion
  - `--status` flag for quick swarm status check without execution
  - `--reset-task TRD-XXX` flag for manual task retry
  - Inherits all strategy detection and specialist selection from `implement-trd-enhanced`

## [4.0.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- Initial release extracted from ensemble v3.x monolith
- Plugin structure created for modular installation

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- `implement-trd-beads` v2.2.0: team-based execution model with role-based handoffs
  - `team:` YAML section: optional top-level configuration for role-based execution (lead, builder, reviewer, qa roles)
  - Per-task state machine: sub-state tracking via br comments (in_progress/in_review/in_qa/closed)
  - Lead orchestration loop: tech-lead-orchestrator drives task assignment, reviewer/QA delegation
  - Reviewer delegation: code-reviewer evaluates each task implementation with APPROVED/REJECTED verdict
  - QA delegation: qa-orchestrator validates acceptance criteria and test coverage
  - Rejection loop: reviewer/QA rejections return task to builder with full context; max 2 cycles before lead escalation
  - Parallel builders: up to N concurrent builder slots with file conflict detection and sequential commits
  - Optional skip gating: lead can skip review and/or QA per task with audit trail
  - Cross-session resume: team sub-states reconstructed from br comments on resume
  - Team metrics: per-phase performance summary (builder pass rates, cycle times, rejection counts)
  - Wheel instructions: team-aware output with topology, lifecycle diagram, NTM spawn commands

### Backward Compatibility

- No breaking changes -- team mode is opt-in via `team:` section in command YAML
- Absence of `team:` section preserves identical v2.1.0 single-agent behavior
- All existing scaffolds (v2.1.0) are compatible with v2.2.0
