Walk a story's PRD acceptance criteria one at a time with a QA engineer after
implement-trd-beads has shipped a PR boundary, grounding each proposed Playwright
test in the real implementing code rather than PRD prose alone, running it against
the target application's QA environment, and syncing confirmed tests to an Azure
DevOps Test Case/Suite as plain-English steps.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Scaffold

**1. Trigger Check — Open PR Required**
   REQ-001: this session may only start once implement-trd-beads has
shipped a PR boundary for the target branch. TRD-031: the target
repo may be hosted on GitHub or Azure DevOps Repos — detect which
before checking, never assume gh/GitHub.


   - Resolve E2E_LIB — the directory holding this command's own helper modules — before any other action, reusing beads-build.yaml's resolution convention: (1) $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null) joined with /packages/e2e-testing/lib (canonical monorepo root); (2) the legacy CWD-relative packages/e2e-testing/lib; (3) the Claude Code plugin root ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib, which is where the installed ensemble-e2e-testing plugin keeps them. Use the first that exists. If none do, HALT with: 'ERROR: cannot locate the helper modules this command needs. Install the ensemble-e2e-testing plugin, or run from the ensemble monorepo.'
   - Every $E2E_LIB/<module>.js reference in the steps below resolves against that one value. These modules ship inside the plugin — the consuming repository is never expected to contain them, and a missing packages/ directory in the repo you are working in is not a reason to stop.
   - Resolve the target branch: current git branch, or the branch backing the story/PR reference argument
   - Call detectRepoHost() from $E2E_LIB/pr-state.js
   - If host is "github" or "unknown": call checkPrState(branch) from the same module (unchanged gh-based behavior)
   - If host is "azure-devops": call the Azure DevOps MCP server's PR-list tool (e.g. repo_list_pull_requests_by_repo_or_project) with detectRepoHost()'s resolved organization/project/repository, then call checkPrStateAdo(branch, prs) from the same module to get the normalized result
   - If hasOpenPr is false: halt the session and print pr-state.js's NO_OPEN_PR_MESSAGE (run /ensemble:implement-trd-beads first) — do not proceed to grounding, execution, or sync
   - If hasOpenPr is true: proceed with the session on that same branch/PR — all authored test commits land there
   - Carry the result's baseBranch (the PR's real target branch, e.g. "integration" on some repos) forward as the session's resolved base branch — every groundImplementation() call in the next step passes it as opts.baseBranch, never letting that module fall back to guessing main/origin-main

**2. Parse PRD, Ground Every REQ, Flag Gaps, and Resume-Scan**
   TRD-025/TRD-042 (satisfies REQ-002, REQ-009, REQ-011): build the
story's full coverage picture before asking anything else. This is
what makes PR 1's promise real — "lists every AC for that story,
whether it already has a confirmed test, and which REQ's
implementation code was found." TRD-042 (found presenting this
report to a QA engineer): a bare "gap" label doesn't say what's
actually wrong — every gap in the report must be labeled with
exactly one of four kinds, never a generic "gap":
  - TRD gap: the TRD itself doesn't say what implements this REQ
    at all (groundImplementation()'s gapType: 'trd-gap') — the
    planning document has a hole, not the codebase.
  - Code gap: the TRD does say what should implement this REQ,
    but that code isn't actually there (gapType: 'code-gap').
  - AC gap: the code was found, but an agent's judgment (or a
    persisted @ac-gap marker from a prior session) says it
    doesn't satisfy this specific AC.
  - Test coverage gap: the code was found AND satisfies the AC —
    there's simply no confirmed test for it yet.


   - Call parsePrdAcs(prdText) from $E2E_LIB/prd-ac-parser.js to get {documentId, label, reqs: [{id, acs: [{id, text}]}]}
   - For each REQ, call groundImplementation(reqId, trdPath, {baseBranch}) from $E2E_LIB/implementation-grounding.js, passing Step 1's resolved baseBranch every time — never omit it. A {grounded: false, gap: true, gapType, reason} result is a structural grounding gap: label every AC under that REQ with "TRD gap" when gapType is "trd-gap", or "Code gap" when gapType is "code-gap" — report the reason plainly, and do not proceed to the next action for that REQ's ACs (there is no diff yet to judge against an AC)
   - For each AC under a grounded REQ, judge (agent reasoning, not a function call) whether the grounded diff actually produces that AC's stated Given/When/Then outcome. If it does not, call flagAcGap(acId, {reqId, groundingResult, reason}) from $E2E_LIB/ac-gap-detector.js, label it "AC gap" when presenting to the QA engineer, and record their call via resolveGapReview(acId, decision, details) — decision "confirmed" routes to Phase 6 (AC-Gap Task Filing) immediately, not deferred to session end; decision "override" re-runs groundImplementation with details.correctedTargetFiles (still passing the same {baseBranch}) and re-judges before moving on
   - Scan the consuming application's existing E2E test project (its *.spec.ts/*.cs files) on disk and call scanAcCoverage(specTexts, expectedAcIds) from $E2E_LIB/resume-scan.js to split every expected AC into confirmed/manual/gap/pending — its "gap" here means a persisted @ac-gap marker from a prior session; label it "AC gap" the same as a freshly-judged one above, never a bare "gap"
   - For each AC that reached this step with no gap of any kind (grounded REQ, AC judged satisfied, not manual, not confirmed by resume-scan) but resume-scan still reports it "pending": label it "Test coverage gap" — everything upstream is fine, it just has no test yet. This is the only one of the four kinds this session will actually resolve by delegating and landing a test; the other three need a human/TRD/code decision first
   - Print the combined coverage report: every AC labeled with exactly one of TRD gap / Code gap / AC gap / Test coverage gap / Manual / Confirmed — this is PR 1's own Shippable State and must be shown even if the session goes on to do nothing else

**3. Full-Session Idempotence Short-Circuit**
   TRD-030/TRD-023 (satisfies REQ-011, AC-011-2): a fully-covered
story makes no changes and ends here — never reaches the
headed/headless prompt or the REQ loop below.


   - Call isStoryFullyCovered(expectedAcIds, specTexts) from $E2E_LIB/resume-scan.js (same inputs as the coverage scan above)
   - If true: print buildSessionSummary({alreadyComplete: true}) from $E2E_LIB/session-summary.js and end the session now — make no file writes, no delegation calls, and no Azure DevOps calls of any kind
   - If false: continue to the Execution Setup phase below with only the pending ACs from the coverage scan

### Phase 2: Execution Setup

**1. Ask Headed or Headless — Once Per Session**
   REQ-013: before running the first test in the session, ask the QA
engineer (in conversation — this session is interactive via Claude
Code, so "asking" means posing the question directly, not a GUI
dialog) whether they want to watch the browser run (headed) or let
it run independently and report status back (headless). This is a
single, one-time choice for the whole session, made once here
before the first test run — do not re-ask per AC.


   - Before running the first test this session, ask the QA engineer: "Would you like to watch these tests run (headed), or should I run them independently and report status back (headless)?"
   - If they do not specify a preference, default to headed — this session is interactive by default
   - Record the chosen mode for the remainder of the session; do not ask again for subsequent ACs/tests

**2. Resolve and Verify the QA Environment**
   TRD-013/TRD-026 (satisfies REQ-013): safety-critical — never let a
test run against anything but the designated QA environment.
TRD-034 (found live-dogfooding this feature): reachable is not the
same as "running this branch's code." Many repos have more than
one QA/staging deploy target (per-branch or per-developer slots
are a common pattern, not specific to any one project) — a
reachable-but-wrong slot produces test failures indistinguishable
from a real regression. Confirm the resolved URL is actually the
right one for this session before proceeding, not just that it
responds.


   - Call resolveQaEnvUrl(opts) from $E2E_LIB/qa-env-guard.js with an explicit opts.url or opts.envVar naming where the target app's QA URL is configured — never hardcode or guess one
   - Call checkQaEnvReachable(url) from the same module. If reachable is false, halt the session here: report the unreachable environment to the QA engineer and do not run, propose, or land any test this session — never fall back to another URL
   - Ask the QA engineer to confirm: "Is <resolved URL> running the code from this session's branch/PR? If this repo uses per-branch or per-developer QA/staging deployments, provide the correct URL for this session instead." Never assume the configured default is correct just because it is reachable — if they provide a different URL, re-run the reachability check against it before proceeding
   - If the consuming repo configures a base auth-state path at all, call deriveAuthStatePath(baseAuthStatePath, url) from $E2E_LIB/test-runner-mode.js to get an environment-scoped authStatePath — regardless of mode (TRD-037: many real harnesses reuse one stored auth state for every run, headed or headless alike); never reuse one static path across different resolved URLs, since a stored auth state is scoped to the origin it was captured against
   - Carry the resolved URL forward as targetEnv, and (when derived) the environment-scoped authStatePath, for every delegation request in the REQ loop below

### Phase 3: REQ Batching and Delegation

**1. Batch by REQ, Skip Already-Complete REQs**
   TRD-026 (satisfies REQ-004, REQ-013): REQ-004's checkpointing
starts here — a REQ that is already fully confirmed is never
re-processed, even mid-session on a resumed run.


   - Call batchByReq(parsedAcs, confirmedAcIds) from $E2E_LIB/req-batcher.js, using Phase 1's parsed ACs and its resume-scan confirmed set, to get one {reqId, acs, allDone, checkpointSummary} entry per REQ, in order
   - For each REQ where allDone is true: print its checkpointSummary and move to the next REQ without delegating anything
   - For each REQ where allDone is false: proceed to the next step for each of its still-pending ACs (excluding any already marked manual or ac-gap by Phase 1's resume-scan)

**2. Delegate the Proposal (Ground + Author, No Run) to @playwright-tester**
   TRD-026/TRD-040 (satisfies REQ-005, REQ-013): the per-AC
delegation this TRD's whole architecture is built around
(TRD-008/TRD-040's two-stage contract). This stage only grounds
and authors — it never runs the test. Running happens in Phase 4,
step 2, only after the QA engineer confirms the proposal, so no
real run against the QA environment is ever spent on a test
they haven't seen yet.


   - Build a request {acText, groundingDiff} and validate it with validateProposalRequest(req) from $E2E_LIB/delegation-contract.js — acText is this AC's own text (not the whole REQ), groundingDiff is Phase 1's groundImplementation() result for its REQ
   - Delegate the validated request to @playwright-tester (the ensemble-e2e-testing plugin's playwright-tester agent, resolved by name — not by file path), which grounds the AC and authors a test, plus a plainEnglishSummary of what it does — never running it at this stage
   - Validate the response with validateProposalResponse(res) from delegation-contract.js — it always carries either {proposedTest, selectorsUsed, plainEnglishSummary} or an explicit authoringFailure, never neither
   - If the response is an authoringFailure with no viable alternative: call markManual(acId, reason) from $E2E_LIB/manual-ac-tracker.js, log via logAction({type: "manual-ac-marked", acId, reason}), and move to the next AC — never proceed to Phase 4 with nothing to present

   **Delegation:** @playwright-tester
   Ground one AC in code and propose a Playwright test, with a plain-English summary of what it does — do not run it yet, per $E2E_LIB/delegation-contract.js's Proposal stage.

### Phase 4: Decision and Local Landing

**1. Present the Plain-English Summary and Record the QA Engineer's Pre-Run Decision**
   TRD-027/TRD-040 (satisfies REQ-003, REQ-017): the accept/
request-changes/reject decision point now happens BEFORE the test
ever runs against the QA environment — matching REQ-005's own
wording ("a test the QA engineer HAS ACCEPTED... its pass/fail
result is shown"). Found while adding this step: the prior
single-delegation design actually ran the test before this
decision point could ever be reached, silently inverting the
PRD's intended accept-then-run order and spending a real QA-
environment run on tests a QA engineer might still reject.


   - Present the proposal's plainEnglishSummary to the QA engineer as the primary, easy-to-scan description of what the test does — the full proposedTest source is also available for anyone who wants to check the actual code
   - Call recordDecision(decision, {acId, proposedTest, changeDescription, iterationCount}) from $E2E_LIB/ac-decision-loop.js with exactly one of "accept" | "request-changes" | "reject"
   - outcome "revise": re-delegate the Proposal stage (REQ Batching and Delegation phase, step 2) with changeDescription folded into a fresh request for the same AC, incrementing iterationCount, and re-present the new plainEnglishSummary — never run a test the QA engineer hasn't yet confirmed
   - outcome "manual-escape-hatch" (an outright reject): call markManual(acId, reason) from $E2E_LIB/manual-ac-tracker.js, log via logAction({type: "manual-ac-marked", acId, reason}), and move to the next AC — the test is never run
   - outcome "accepted": continue to the next step to actually run the confirmed test

**2. Run the Confirmed Test**
   TRD-040 (satisfies REQ-005, REQ-013): now that the QA engineer
has confirmed the proposal, actually execute it — headed or
headless, per Phase 2''s resolved mode/environment/auth. TRD-035:
a failing run is not automatically a regression — check for an
environment-mismatch signal before framing it as one.


   - Build a request {acText, groundingDiff, proposedTest, targetEnv, mode, authStatePath} and validate it with validateRunRequest(req) from $E2E_LIB/delegation-contract.js — proposedTest is the exact confirmed source from the previous step (never re-authored), acText/groundingDiff are repeated from Phase 3 step 2 (this is a fresh, stateless delegation with no memory of the Proposal stage), targetEnv/mode/authStatePath are Phase 2's resolved values
   - Delegate the validated request to @playwright-tester, which runs the already-authored test per its own TRD-011 mode-aware logic (test-runner-mode.js's resolveRunConfig) — TRD-035: on a failed run, it also checks the live page for grounded-marker-checker.js's extractGroundedMarkers(groundingDiff.diffs) and reports whether an environment mismatch is suspected
   - Validate the response with validateRunResponse(res) from delegation-contract.js
   - Log the outcome via logAction({type: "run-result", acId, mode, runResult}) from $E2E_LIB/session-logger.js
   - If the run failed and runResult.environmentMismatchSuspected is true: lead the failure report with buildEnvironmentMismatchHint({markersChecked: runResult.groundedMarkersChecked, markersFound: []}) from $E2E_LIB/grounded-marker-checker.js — present this as the LEADING hypothesis, before any suggestion that the implementation itself is broken, and prompt the QA engineer to confirm the environment (Phase 2 Step 2's question) before deciding what to do next
   - The pass/fail result is shown to the QA engineer (AC-005-1) — no further accept/reject decision is needed here, since that already happened in the previous step; a failure is handled per @playwright-tester's own investigate/fix-and-rerun/surface-as-blocker responsibility, not a re-ask. Continue to the next step to land the test only once runResult.passed is true

**3. Land the Confirmed, Passed Test**
   TRD-027 (satisfies REQ-006, REQ-014): write/append the test file
and apply its traceability tag — AC-006-2's existing-file append
must be checked before scaffolding a redundant new one.


   - Determine whether an existing spec file in the consuming application's E2E test project already covers this AC's REQ (e.g. from Phase 1's resume-scan); call writeOrAppendSpecFile(filePath, specDetails) from $E2E_LIB/spec-writer.js — it scaffolds a new file when none exists, or appends a [Test] method to the existing one, never both
   - Call tagTestMethod(fileContent, {acId, acText, reqId, documentId}) from $E2E_LIB/traceability-tagger.js to turn spec-writer.js's plain anchor comment into the full `@hash:`/doc-id/`@REQ` traceability tag
   - Log via logAction({type: "test-written", acId, testName, filePath, mode: "created"|"appended"}) from $E2E_LIB/session-logger.js

### Phase 5: Azure DevOps Test Plan Sync

**1. Resolve or Confirm the Project's Test Plan**
   TRD-038 (satisfies REQ-007): every Test Suite belongs to a Test
Plan — testplan_list_test_suites and testplan_create_test_suite
both require a planId. Found live-dogfooding this feature against
a real project with zero existing Test Plans: never assume one
already exists, and never auto-pick or auto-name one — a Test
Plan is shared, project-wide infrastructure (often scoped to a
single release/iteration and later folded into a longer-lived
regression plan), a real decision for the QA engineer to make.


   - Fetch the project's existing Test Plans (e.g. via the Azure DevOps MCP server's testplan_list_test_plans-equivalent tool)
   - Present the fetched list to the QA engineer and ask them to either pick an existing plan to reuse, or give a name for a new one — never auto-select the only existing plan and never invent a name, even when exactly one plan exists. If they are naming a new plan, mention that Test Plans are often scoped to a release/iteration and later merged into a longer-lived regression plan, so they may want to name it accordingly rather than something implying permanence
   - Call resolveOrCreateTestPlan({existingPlans, selectedPlanId?, newPlanName?}) from $E2E_LIB/ado-test-plan.js with their choice
   - If action is "create": call the MCP test-plan-creation tool with the decision's planName, then call recordCreatedPlan(decision, mcpResponse) to get the tracked {planId, planName}; if action is "resolve", the planId is already known — no MCP call needed
   - Carry the resolved planId forward for every Test Suite call in the next step

**2. Resolve or Confirm the Story's Test Suite**
   TRD-039 (satisfies REQ-007): once per story, not once per AC.
Found live-dogfooding this feature alongside TRD-038: never treat
"no suite matches this story yet" as silent permission to create
one — confirm with the QA engineer first, same principle as the
QA-environment-verification fix (TRD-034).


   - Fetch the story's existing Test Suites within the resolved planId (e.g. via the Azure DevOps MCP server's testplan_list_test_suites-equivalent tool) and call resolveOrCreateTestSuite({planId, workItemId, storyTitle, existingSuites}) from $E2E_LIB/ado-test-suite.js
   - If action is "create": before calling the MCP test-suite-creation tool, present the decision's suiteName to the QA engineer and confirm — create this new suite, or reuse one of the fetched existingSuites instead? If they pick an existing suite, re-call resolveOrCreateTestSuite with selectedSuiteId set to their choice and use its "resolve" result in place of the original "create" decision
   - Once creation is confirmed: call the MCP test-suite-creation tool with the decision's planId/suiteName linked to workItemId, then call recordCreatedSuite(decision, mcpResponse) to get the tracked {suiteId, suiteName, workItemId, planId}; if action is "resolve" (whether an automatic match or a QA-engineer selection), the suiteId is already known — no MCP call needed

**3. Sync Each Landed Test's Steps as a Test Case**
   TRD-028 (satisfies REQ-007, REQ-008): AC-007-2's update-in-place
behavior on re-sync, and REQ-008's retry/flag-without-rollback
resilience, both apply here.


   - For each just-landed, tagged test: extract its ordered plain-text step descriptions (from its narration/comments) and check findAdoTestCaseTag(fileContent, acId) from $E2E_LIB/traceability-tagger.js for an already-synced id
   - Call planTestCaseSync({acId, acText, steps, suiteId, existingAdoTestCaseId}) from $E2E_LIB/ado-test-case-sync.js, then call the MCP Test-Case create/update tool (testplan_create_test_case / add-to-suite equivalent) accordingly
   - On success: call recordSyncedTestCase(decision, mcpResponse), then addAdoTestCaseTag(fileContent, acId, testCaseId) from traceability-tagger.js to persist the id for future re-syncs; log via logAction({type: "sync-result", acId, ...syncedRecord})
   - On failure: call recordSyncAttempt(state, {success: false, error}) from $E2E_LIB/ado-sync-resilience.js. Decision "retry": troubleshoot per its note and retry this step for the same AC. Decision "flag-unsynced": call flagUnsynced(acId, state), log it, and move on — the local test file landed in the previous phase is NEVER rolled back regardless of sync outcome

### Phase 6: AC-Gap Task Filing

**1. File One ADO Task Per Confirmed Gap**
   TRD-029 (satisfies REQ-010): fires as soon as Phase 1's gap review
resolves "confirmed" for an AC — do not batch every gap to the
end of the session; AC-010-2 requires one Task per gap, never
bundled, and this module's own shape enforces that (no batching
parameter exists).


   - For each AC whose Phase 1 resolveGapReview() call resolved to "gap-confirmed": call resolveImplementingAuthor(groundingResult.files) from $E2E_LIB/ac-gap-task-filer.js (never throws — an unresolved author still proceeds, unassigned)
   - Resolve that git identity to an Azure DevOps identity via the MCP server's core_get_identity_ids-equivalent tool, then call planGapTaskFiling({acId, reqId, gapReason, storyWorkItemId, author}) to shape the Task request
   - Call the MCP work-item-creation tool (wit_create_work_item + wit_add_child_work_items equivalent) linking the new Task under the PRD-referenced Story, then call recordFiledGapTask(decision, mcpResponse)
   - Log via logAction({type: "gap-task-filed", ...gapRecord}) from $E2E_LIB/session-logger.js

### Phase 7: Checkpoints and Session Summary

**1. Per-REQ Checkpoint**
   TRD-030 (satisfies REQ-004, REQ-012): printed once every AC in the
current REQ has been decided (confirmed, manual, or gap) —
the QA engineer may stop here and resume later via Phase 1's resume-scan.


   - Once a REQ's ACs are all decided, call buildSessionSummary({scope: "checkpoint", reqId, testsWritten, testsConfirmed, manualAcs, adoTestCasesSynced, gapTasksFiled}) from $E2E_LIB/session-summary.js, using this REQ's own accumulated items, and print it
   - Ask the QA engineer whether to continue to the next REQ or stop the session here — either is a clean, resumable stopping point

**2. Final Session Summary**
   TRD-030 (satisfies REQ-012, REQ-016): printed once every REQ has
been processed (or the session is stopped early).


   - Call buildSessionSummary({scope: "session", testsWritten, testsConfirmed, manualAcs, adoTestCasesSynced, gapTasksFiled}) from $E2E_LIB/session-summary.js, using the whole session's accumulated items across every REQ, and print it as the session's closing message
   - Every action taken anywhere in this workflow (test-written, run-result, sync-result, gap-task-filed, manual-ac-marked) must already have been logged via logAction as it happened ($E2E_LIB/session-logger.js) — this final summary is a rollup, not the only record of what occurred

## Expected Output

**Format:** Confirmed Playwright tests synced to Azure DevOps

**Structure:**
- **Test Files**: Playwright test specs landed for confirmed acceptance criteria
- **Azure DevOps Test Cases**: Plain-English steps synced to the target ADO Test Case/Suite
- **AC-Gap Tasks**: One ADO Task per confirmed implementation gap, filed on the referenced Story
- **Session/Checkpoint Summaries**: Human-readable counts of tests written/confirmed/manual/synced/gap-filed, printed after each REQ and at session end
