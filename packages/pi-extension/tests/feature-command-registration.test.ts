/**
 * TRD-003 / TRD-003-TEST: native `ensemble-feature` command registration.
 *
 * `registerDispatcherCommand`'s own generic contract (parse/complete/forward)
 * is already proved by dispatcher-commands.test.ts against a synthetic
 * `issue.yaml` fixture. This file instead proves the *call site* added to
 * extension.ts's real `activate()` for the fourth dispatcher command,
 * `ensemble-feature` -- that it actually registers natively when the real
 * `packages/development/commands/feature.yaml` is present, stays a no-op
 * when it is absent (this extension loads in every repo the host opens),
 * and that its action list is sourced from that YAML rather than a
 * hardcoded TypeScript list -- so wording is editable with no rebuild.
