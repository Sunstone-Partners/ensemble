// Real activation smoke test for AC-004-1: loads the pi-extension through
// Pi's actual extension loader (discoverAndLoadExtensions) and confirms it
// activates with no load-time errors and registers the four dispatcher
// commands.
//
// Run directly (not through jest): jiti-loaded TypeScript, and
// @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent is ESM-only, so this must run as a real
// Node ESM process rather than under jest's CommonJS resolver.
//
// discoverAndLoadExtensions also auto-discovers from standard Pi locations
// on this machine, so the result may contain more than our one extension —
// we find ours by resolvedPath rather than assuming array length 1.
//
// This repo (not this fixture) has no dispatcher YAML at its own root, so
// registerDispatcherCommand's own no-op contract applies here: zero
// commands registered is the correct, expected outcome for this checkout.
// The real registration path is covered by
// tests/feature-command-registration.test.ts and
// tests/issue-command-completion.test.ts against fixture repos that do
// have the YAML. This script exists only to prove the real ESM loader
// accepts the compiled extension with zero load-time errors -- a path
// jest's CommonJS resolver cannot exercise at all.
