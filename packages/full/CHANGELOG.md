## [4.0.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- Initial release extracted from ensemble v3.x monolith
- Plugin structure created for modular installation

## [Unreleased]

## [6.9.2] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Preserve verbatim source TRD task markdown in generated workstream tasks so deterministic parsing does not discard semantic detail.

## [6.9.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Decompose workstream TRD acceptance criteria into AC-level implementation, test, and validation tasks.

## [6.9.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Add `beads-scaffold-specialist` for Beads hierarchy/dependency graph scaffolding and repair without product-code implementation.

## [6.8.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Reuse the source PRD micro UUID for generated TRD IDs; workstream TRDs still generate their own micro UUID.

## [6.8.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Use micro UUID document IDs for generated PRD/TRD/workstream artifact filenames to avoid sequence-number collisions across large teams.

## [6.7.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Add `/ensemble:create-workstream-trd` to generate a single executable workstream TRD from multiple source TRDs while preserving provenance.
- Deprecate direct multi-TRD `/ensemble:implement-trd-beads` execution; require generated workstream TRDs by default.

## [6.6.5] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Scaffold explicit AC-* validation and XC-* cross-cutting beads, and enforce Definition of Done gates before bead closure.

## [6.6.4] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Resolve shorthand agent names to installed namespaced plugin agents before Task delegation.

## [6.6.3] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Keep implement-trd-beads running through routine progress milestones; only pause for real user decisions.

## [6.6.2] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Parse TRD scalar frontmatter without requiring installed npm dependencies in plugin cache.

- Plugin extraction and population (in progress)

## [6.6.1] - 2026-06-18
