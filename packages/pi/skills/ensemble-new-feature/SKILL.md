# ensemble-new-feature

> **Mission:** Chain the existing standalone create-prd, refine-prd, create-trd, refine-trd, and beads-planning skills into one fixed-order, resumable run -- the same in-session execution mechanism every other product command in this repo already uses (see fix-issue.yaml), not a new subprocess-orchestration layer. What's new is RunIndexStore: an atomic, concurrency-safe checkpoint of which stage a run is at, its outcome, and the exact artifact references each stage produced, so the workflow is resumable across sessions and never guesses which stage to run next from file-presence alone.

> **Constraints:**
> - Stage order is fixed and never reordered at runtime: prd_create -> prd_refine -> trd_create -> trd_refine -> beads_plan -> implementation_approval -> implementation -> pr_approval -> pr_create -> done. pr_approval/pr_create are only entered if a PR was requested; completion without a PR request is a valid terminal state.
> - Only the stage recorded as RunRecord.stage, with stageOutcome.kind not "success", is eligible to run on a given invocation -- a later stage is never entered because a same-named output file happens to already exist on disk.
> - Single active run per project, enforced at create time by RunIndexStore.createRun()'s active.lock (TRD-010).
> - All stage transitions and artifact references are recorded through RunIndexStore (see TRD-002).

## Arguments

- **`idea`** (string, optional): Free-text description of the feature to build. Starts a new run at stage prd_create. Mutually exclusive with `path`; omit both to resume the project's active run or show its status.
- **`path`** (string, optional): An indexed PRD or TRD artifact path to resume from (resolved via RunIndexStore.resolveByArtifact; never globbed). If `path` is not indexed by any run but is itself a readable PRD document (frontmatter `document_id` matching `PRD-*`), it is adopted as a new run's source via RunIndexStore.createRunFromArtifact, entering at prd_refine instead of prd_create -- any other unindexed path is still rejected.
- **`status`** (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Show the active/most-recent run's stage, outcome, and references without advancing it.
- **`abandon`** (string, optional): Terminate the project's active/paused run after explicit confirmation. Any given text is an optional reason, recorded in the run's terminal history alongside the retained artifacts/ references. If `idea` or `path` is also given, that takes precedence -- Step 2/3 below run first and this step is never reached (Steps 2-6 are evaluated in order, first match wins); omit `idea`/`path`/`status` for `abandon` to take effect.

## Phase 1: Entry Point Resolution

### Step 1: Reject Unsupported Flags Before Any Stage Runs

--skip-refine and equivalents are rejected in option validation, before createRun/resolveByArtifact are ever called.

**Actions:**
1. If the invocation includes `--skip-refine` or any documented equivalent flag that would bypass prd_refine or trd_refine: reject immediately with 'Both PRD and TRD refinement are mandatory in new-feature's fixed stage order. To skip orchestration but not refinement, run the standalone /ensemble-refine-prd or /ensemble-refine-trd commands directly -- they are unmodified by new-feature.' and HALT. No stage executes, no run is created or mutated (AC-003-1, AC-003-2).
2. This check runs before Steps 2-4 below -- a rejected invocation never reaches createRun/resolveByArtifact.
3. De-advertisement pointer (REQ-009): this workflow is the internal implementation behind the canonical front door `/ensemble-feature` (keywords `new`/`resume`/`status`/`abandon`). Direct invocation of this command still works and behaves identically -- same createRun/resolveByArtifact/mutate calls, same run record, same stage machine, zero behavior change. The only addition is one informational line appended after whichever of Steps 2-4 below prints its own output: 'Driven directly via /ensemble-new-feature; /ensemble-feature is the canonical front door for this workflow.' This line never gates, delays, or alters any step's own decision.

### Step 2: Idea Input -- Start a New Run

An `idea` argument with no active run for the project starts a fresh run at prd_create.

**Actions:**
1. If `idea` is provided (and `path` is not -- mutually exclusive per the `idea` parameter's own description): call RunIndexStore.createRun(projectRoot, idea).
2. RunIndexStore.createRun() enforces single-active-run exclusivity at create time (TRD-010): if it throws RUN_ALREADY_ACTIVE, print 'A run is already active for this project: <existingRunId>. Resume it with no arguments (or --status to inspect it first), or abandon it before starting a new one.' and stop -- no new run is created.
3. Otherwise print the new run's identifier (runId) and that it starts at stage prd_create (AC-001-1).
4. Set ACTIVE_RUN to the created record; proceed to Stage Resolution.

### Step 3: Artifact-Path Input -- Resume an Indexed Run, or Adopt an Unindexed PRD

A `path` argument resumes the exact run that indexed it. If `path` is not indexed by any run but is itself a readable PRD document, it is adopted as a new run's source, entering at prd_refine -- any other unindexed path is still rejected.

**Actions:**
1. If `path` is provided: call RunIndexStore.resolveByArtifact(projectRoot, path).
2. Found: print the matched artifact reference (type, documentId, version, producingStage) and the run's recorded stage (AC-001-2); set ACTIVE_RUN to that record; proceed to Stage Resolution.
3. Not found, and `path` does not exist on disk (or cannot be read): reject with 'No indexed run references <path>, and no file exists at that path to adopt as a new run's source.' Create no run; advance nothing (AC-001-3).
4. Not found, `path` exists and is readable, but its frontmatter has no `document_id` matching `PRD-*` (a TRD, an unrelated file, or malformed frontmatter): reject with 'No indexed run references <path>. Only artifact paths recorded by a prior new-feature run can be resumed, and <path> is not a PRD document (no PRD-prefixed document_id in its frontmatter) -- to work on this file directly, use the standalone /ensemble-refine-prd or /ensemble-refine-trd command instead.' Create no run; advance nothing (AC-001-3).
5. Not found, `path` exists and is readable, and its frontmatter has a `document_id` matching `PRD-*`: adopt it as the source of a brand-new run instead of rejecting. Read `document_id` and `version` from the file's frontmatter. Call RunIndexStore.createRunFromArtifact(projectRoot, <the PRD's H1 title, falling back to its document_id>, { type: 'prd', path, documentId, version, producingStage: 'prd_create' }, 'prd_refine'). This enters at prd_refine, not prd_create -- the PRD already exists, so creation is skipped and only refinement runs next. Print the new run's identifier and that it starts at stage prd_refine, adopting the given PRD. Set ACTIVE_RUN to the created record; proceed to Stage Resolution. This is the supported path for driving an existing, already-written PRD through the rest of the pipeline (TRD, beads, implementation) without re-authoring it.
6. RunIndexStore.createRunFromArtifact() enforces the same single-active-run exclusivity as createRun(): if it throws RUN_ALREADY_ACTIVE, print 'A run is already active for this project: <existingRunId>. Resume it with no arguments (or --status to inspect it first), or abandon it before starting a new one.' and stop -- no new run is created.

### Step 4: No Arguments -- Resume Active or Show Status

Neither idea nor path resumes the project's active/paused run, or (with --status) reports it read-only -- a run parked by failure is shown, never auto-re-executed, until the user explicitly confirms (AC-006-3).

**Actions:**
1. If `status` is true: this is a read-only report (TRD-011) -- never a resume. No stage executes and no mutate() call is made regardless of what is found. Call RunIndexStore.findActive(projectRoot); if found, STATUS_RUN is that record. If not found, RunIndexStore's public interface has no dedicated "most recent terminal run" query (this step's Target File is this YAML only, not run-index.ts): read every run file under .ensemble/new-feature/ directly (excluding active.lock), pick the one with the latest updatedAt, and set STATUS_RUN to it, or to undefined if no run file exists at all.
2. status=true, STATUS_RUN undefined: print 'No runs found for this project. Start one with --idea "<description>".' Stop here.
3. status=true, STATUS_RUN found: print the five required fields (AC-012-1): run identifier, current stage, last stageOutcome.kind (with detail, when the outcome is a pending decision or a failure), and every recorded artifacts[] and beadRefs[] reference. If STATUS_RUN.status is "completed" or "abandoned": state that terminal outcome explicitly alongside the retained references. Never imply a PR was created or merged (AC-012-2) unless BOTH STATUS_RUN.prApprovedAt is non-null AND a PR reference is present among the recorded references -- specifically a beadRefs[] entry carrying TRD-017's "pr:" prefix (artifacts[] only ever holds type "prd"/"trd" per TRD-001's fixed schema, so a PR reference can only live in beadRefs[], and a bare bead ID there is never itself a PR reference); if either is missing, state plainly that no PR exists. Stop here -- status is always read-only and never proceeds to Stage Resolution.
4. If `status` is false, `abandon` is not provided, and neither `idea` nor `path` is provided: call RunIndexStore.findActive(projectRoot).
5. status=false, not found: nothing to resume; print that no active run exists and how to start one (`--idea "<description>"`). Stop here.
6. status=false, found, and ACTIVE_RUN.stageOutcome.kind is "failure": this is a paused-by-failure run. Print the parked stage, the recorded failure detail, and ask the user (ask or equivalent) 'Retry <stage>? [yes/no]' -- do NOT proceed to Stage Resolution on a bare invocation alone. Only an explicit 'yes' here (this is what TRD-008 means by "explicit retry") sets ACTIVE_RUN and proceeds to Stage Resolution; 'no' or no response stops here with stage/stageOutcome/revision completely unchanged -- no mutate() call is made merely by viewing this prompt (AC-006-3).
7. status=false, found, and ACTIVE_RUN.stageOutcome.kind is anything else ("approval_wait", "decline", or a freshly created run that has never run a stage yet): no confirmation gate applies -- set ACTIVE_RUN and proceed directly to Stage Resolution. Declined/approval-wait states are not failures; re-running them on resume is the normal, expected flow.

### Step 5: Event-Triggered Entry (Opt-In)

A project may opt into event-triggered starts via .ensemble/new-feature/event-mapping.json (TRD-012); absent that file, this path never fires and the manual idea/path/status entry above is entirely unaffected. This step only applies when the invocation originates from a configured event delivery, not from interactive arguments.

**Actions:**
1. Call EventMappingConfig.loadEventMapping(projectRoot) (agent-core new-feature/event-mapping.ts). If it returns null: default-deny -- no run starts, nothing under RunIndexStore is touched (AC-009-1). Stop here; this is not an error, it is the normal state for a project that has not opted in.
2. If a config exists: call validateEventPayload(mapping, event) BEFORE any RunIndexStore call is made (TRD-018's ordering guarantee -- validation always precedes createRun()/mutate(), never after a partial state change). validateEventPayload is a pure function; it has no RunIndexStore side effect of its own.
3. Rejected (`ok: false`, e.g. disallowed event type, missing source, or missing summary): create no PRD, advance no run, and report the exact `reason` string as the pending step (AC-009-3). Stop here.
4. Accepted: present the event source and full payload to the user via ask for explicit review BEFORE any PRD-stage work begins (AC-009-2). This review is in addition to, not a substitute for, the same PRD elicitation manual /ensemble-create-prd invocation already requires -- the payload's `summary` only seeds elicitation, it is never treated as a complete PRD input by itself.
5. On user decline: create no PRD, advance no run, and report that PRD elicitation review was declined as the pending step (AC-009-3). Stop here.
6. On approval: proceed exactly as Step 2 (Idea Input) above, using `event.summary` as the `idea` argument -- same createRun() call, same TRD-010 single-active-run exclusivity, same full PRD elicitation. Event-triggered and manual starts converge on the identical entry path from this point on.

### Step 6: Abandon Confirmation Gate

`--abandon` terminates the project's active/paused run after explicit confirmation; any given text is an optional reason recorded in the run's terminal history (AC-007-3). Checked before Step 4's no-arguments handling -- when `abandon` is provided, Step 4's resume/status branches never apply.

**Actions:**
1. If `abandon` is provided (a non-empty string or an empty string both count as provided -- only an entirely omitted parameter skips this step): call RunIndexStore.findActive(projectRoot).
2. Not found: print 'No active run exists for this project; nothing to abandon.' and stop -- no mutate()/abandon() call is made, no state is touched (AC-007-3 no-active-run case).
3. Found: ask the user for explicit confirmation (ask or equivalent) before calling RunIndexStore.abandon() -- name the run's identifier and current stage in the prompt. Declined or no response: make no mutate()/abandon() call; the run is left completely untouched, stage/stageOutcome/revision unchanged (AC-007-3 decline case).
4. On explicit confirmation: call RunIndexStore.abandon(projectRoot, runId, reason), where `reason` is the `abandon` parameter's own text value (empty string if none was given). This sets status to "abandoned" and records the terminal outcome via the same mutate() path abandon() already wraps, then releases active.lock -- artifacts and history remain retained, exactly as a later `--status` invocation would still report them (AC-007-3 confirmed case).

## Phase 2: Stage Resolution

### Step 1: Load Current Checkpoint

Read the run's current stage and stageOutcome from RunIndexStore before deciding anything else.

**Actions:**
1. Resolve the active run (see TRD-005/TRD-006 for exact entry-point selection between idea/path/status/resume). For this phase, assume ACTIVE_RUN is already resolved to a RunRecord.
2. Read ACTIVE_RUN.stage and ACTIVE_RUN.stageOutcome.kind.
3. If ACTIVE_RUN.stageOutcome.kind === "success": the stage that just succeeded is complete; ELIGIBLE_STAGE is the next entry in the fixed STAGE_ORDER after ACTIVE_RUN.stage (types.ts's STAGE_ORDER; "done" has no successor -- a run at "done" with a success outcome has nothing left to run).
4. Else (stageOutcome.kind is "approval_wait", "decline", or "failure"): ELIGIBLE_STAGE is ACTIVE_RUN.stage itself -- the current stage has not completed, so it (and only it) is what runs next, regardless of what files already exist on disk with plausible names for a later stage.
5. Never consult the filesystem (glob, ls, or similar) to decide ELIGIBLE_STAGE. The only input to this decision is RunIndexStore.
6. Material-plan-change staleness check (TRD-015): if the computed ELIGIBLE_STAGE is "implementation" and ACTIVE_RUN.implementationApprovedAt is non-null, compare it against the recordedAt of every artifacts[] entry whose producingStage is "trd_refine" or "beads_plan". If any such entry's recordedAt is later than implementationApprovedAt, the approved plan has materially changed since approval (a different TRD version or a different bead set) -- call RunIndexStore.mutate() to set implementationApprovedAt = null and stage = "implementation_approval" in the same call, then re-run this step: ELIGIBLE_STAGE becomes "implementation_approval" again, never "implementation" on a stale approval (AC-010-3). If no later entry exists, approval is still current and ELIGIBLE_STAGE stays "implementation".

### Step 2: Dispatch to the Eligible Stage

Route execution to exactly the one stage ELIGIBLE_STAGE names.

**Actions:**
1. Dispatch on ELIGIBLE_STAGE (exact match, no fallthrough): prd_create -> Execute Stage: PRD Creation (TRD-004); prd_refine -> Execute Stage: PRD Refinement (TRD-004); trd_create -> Execute Stage: TRD Creation (TRD-004); trd_refine -> Execute Stage: TRD Refinement (TRD-004); beads_plan -> Execute Stage: Bead Planning (TRD-004); implementation_approval -> Implementation Approval Checkpoint (TRD-014); implementation -> not wired by this TRD (see next action); pr_approval -> PR Approval Checkpoint (TRD-017); pr_create -> Execute Stage: PR Creation (TRD-017); done -> Print terminal status (TRD-011); nothing to run.
2. The "implementation" stage itself (actually writing code from the approved bead plan) is intentionally never wired by this TRD -- no task in the Master Task List gives it a body. Once implementation_approval is granted, `stage` advances to "implementation" and a separate, already-existing product command performs that work (this very /ensemble-implement-trd-beads --execute flow); reaching the unwired "implementation" ELIGIBLE_STAGE here prints 'ERROR: stage implementation is not yet implemented in this build -- run /ensemble-implement-trd-beads --execute against the approved bead plan, then resume this run' and halts without corrupting RunIndexStore state (no mutate() call is made).
3. pr_approval and pr_create's own dispatch logic is wired by TRD-017 below and is fully correct against whatever RunIndexStore state it finds -- but nothing in this TRD's scope ever advances `stage` past the unwired "implementation" slot to reach them automatically; that requires a mechanism (e.g. a future task, or an operator-driven RunIndexStore.mutate() after confirming implementation is done) outside this build. pr_approval/pr_create are reachable and tested against real RunIndexStore state regardless of how that state arose.
4. Store-persisted-approval precondition (TRD-019, AC-014-2), binding on whatever future work wires "implementation": that call site must read RunIndexStore.loadRun()'s current implementationApprovedAt directly immediately before acting, and deny the operation on a null value regardless of what any surrounding conversational/prompt text claims about approval having been given -- only a real mutate() call from the Implementation Approval Checkpoint (TRD-014) legitimately sets it.

## Phase 3: Execute Stage

### Step 1: Load and Execute the Stage's Existing Skill Body

Each of the five stages below wraps an existing, unmodified standalone skill.

**Actions:**
1. Dispatch ELIGIBLE_STAGE to its existing skill, in-session, exactly as that skill already runs standalone: prd_create -> ensemble-create-prd, input = the run's `idea`; prd_refine -> ensemble-refine-prd, input = the PRD artifacts[] entry `prd_create` (or the latest `prd_refine`) recorded; trd_create -> ensemble-create-trd, input = the PRD artifacts[] entry `prd_refine` recorded; trd_refine -> ensemble-refine-trd, input = the TRD artifacts[] entry `trd_create` recorded; beads_plan -> ensemble-implement-trd-beads --plan, input = the TRD artifacts[] entry `trd_refine` recorded.
2. Never pass a freshly globbed or conversationally-recalled path to any of these -- always the exact `path` from the named artifacts[] entry (AC-004-2). `beads_plan`'s `--plan` flag is load-bearing: it stops after the beads-build Scaffold phase and never reaches beads-build's Execute phase, since nothing in this PR has granted implementation approval yet.

### Step 2: Record the Stage Outcome

Checkpoint success, decline, or failure through RunIndexStore immediately after the stage body returns.

**Actions:**
1. On the stage's skill body completing with a real, saved output artifact (a new/updated PRD or TRD file for prd_create/prd_refine/ trd_create/trd_refine, or a scaffolded bead epic for beads_plan): call RunIndexStore.mutate() to append the exact { type, path, documentId, version, producingStage, recordedAt } to artifacts[] (AC-004-1), set stageOutcome to { kind: "success", recordedAt: now() }, and advance stage to the next entry in STAGE_ORDER -- all inside the same mutate() call so the artifact append and stage advance are never observed separately (no window where artifacts[] has the new entry but stage has not advanced, or vice versa).
2. On a PRD/TRD revision during prd_refine/trd_refine: append the new artifacts[] entry; do not overwrite or remove the prior entry for that document (AC-004-3) -- both remain for history and recovery.
3. On the user declining to accept the stage's output (an explicit decline, not an error): call RunIndexStore.mutate() setting stageOutcome to { kind: "decline", detail: <reason>, recordedAt: now() }; stage does not advance; artifacts[] is unchanged. Ask the user for the correction/input needed to continue -- do not advance and do not silently retry with no new input (AC-007-1).
4. On an edit/regenerate request (the user asks for a revised PRD/TRD rather than declining outright): produce the new version, then call RunIndexStore.mutate() to append its artifacts[] entry exactly as step 1 above (preserving the prior version, per AC-004-3) -- but do NOT advance `stage` and do NOT set stageOutcome.kind to "success" until the user explicitly accepts the new version. No dependent stage may be dispatched while the edited version sits unaccepted (AC-007-2): Stage Resolution's ELIGIBLE_STAGE stays pinned to the current stage exactly as it does for any other non-success outcome.

### Step 3: Handle Stage Failure

An exception or reported failure from Step 1 pauses the run at the failed stage; it is never auto-retried within the same invocation.

**Actions:**
1. Wrap Step 1's stage execution: if it throws an exception or reports a failure, call RunIndexStore.mutate() setting stageOutcome to { kind: "failure", detail: <error message>, recordedAt: now() } at the CURRENT stage (do not advance `stage`); leave artifacts[] exactly as it was before this invocation (AC-006-1).
2. Print the error and the stage name it occurred in.
3. Do not advance, do not retry, do not re-dispatch any stage within this same invocation -- the run simply ends here. A second invocation with no explicit retry action must leave stage/stageOutcome/revision completely unchanged (AC-006-3); it is Step 4 below (TRD-008) that defines what an explicit retry looks like.

### Step 4: Explicit-Retry-Only Resume of a Failed Stage

Only Entry Point Resolution step 4's explicit 'yes' confirmation reaches this phase for a failed run -- never an ambient auto-retry, never the completed stages before it.

**Actions:**
1. Reaching this phase at all for a stage whose stageOutcome.kind was "failure" already means Entry Point Resolution step 4 (TRD-007/AC-006-3's confirmation gate) asked 'Retry <stage>?' and the user answered yes -- that confirmation, not the bare invocation that preceded it, is what AC-006-2's "explicit retry" means. Stage Resolution's existing logic then pins ELIGIBLE_STAGE to that same parked stage (stageOutcome.kind is not "success").
2. Re-execute Step 1 for that one stage with the same or user-edited input. On success, only that stage's artifact/outcome changes (Step 1/2 above); every earlier stage's recorded artifacts[] entries are untouched -- they are never re-executed or re-derived by a retry.
3. Stages after the parked one remain blocked (Stage Resolution never names them ELIGIBLE_STAGE) until this retry succeeds.

### Step 5: Implementation Approval Checkpoint

The implementation_approval stage is a bespoke human checkpoint, not one of the five document-producing stages Step 1 dispatches to -- nothing past this point runs without a recorded approval timestamp.

**Actions:**
1. Present the run's accepted PRD/TRD references (the artifacts[] entries recorded by prd_refine/trd_refine) and the bead plan (beadRefs[], recorded by beads_plan) to the user via ask, exactly matching what is in the run record -- never a re-derived or re-globbed summary (AC-010-1).
2. Wait for an explicit approval response.
3. On explicit approval: call RunIndexStore.mutate() setting implementationApprovedAt = now() and advancing stage to "implementation", both inside the same mutate() call (no window where one is set without the other).
4. On absent or declined approval: perform no implementation work. Do not call mutate() at all -- the run stays parked at implementation_approval with implementationApprovedAt still null, exactly as before this invocation, ready for a later resume (AC-010-2).

### Step 6: PR Approval Checkpoint

PR creation is optional, entered only after the user opts in following implementation completion, and requires an approval distinct from implementation_approval's.

**Actions:**
1. PR creation is entered only if the user opts in after implementation completes; declining records the outcome with no PrProvider call made at all (not even isAvailable()) -- this is a separate checkpoint, never folded into implementation_approval's approval step.
2. On opt-in: construct a GhCliPrProvider and call isAvailable(). If false: create no PR, call RunIndexStore.mutate() to record the outcome (stageOutcome detail names "no PR provider available"), and leave the completed implementation record otherwise untouched (AC-011-3) -- advance stage to "done" (no PR requested is a valid terminal state).
3. If isAvailable() === true: present the target repo/branch/title/body (repo/branch from the run's recorded references, title/body proposed from the accepted PRD/TRD) to the user via ask, then require a separate, immediate explicit approval before calling createPullRequest() -- distinct from implementation's approval step (AC-011-2).
4. On absent/declined approval: create no PR, report the outcome, leave the completed implementation record untouched, and advance stage to "done" (AC-011-1).
5. On explicit approval: call RunIndexStore.mutate() setting prApprovedAt = now() and advancing stage to "pr_create", immediately before the create call -- never in the same mutate() call as implementationApprovedAt.

### Step 7: Execute Stage: PR Creation

Only reached when prApprovedAt is already set by the PR Approval Checkpoint above.

**Actions:**
1. Store-persisted-approval precondition (TRD-019, AC-014-2): before calling createPullRequest(), read RunIndexStore.loadRun()'s current prApprovedAt directly -- never trust conversational/prompt text asserting approval was given. A null prApprovedAt denies the call outright, regardless of what the surrounding context claims; only reaching this stage via the PR Approval Checkpoint's own mutate() call legitimately sets it.
2. Call GhCliPrProvider.createPullRequest() with the exact repo/branch/title/body presented and approved in the PR Approval Checkpoint -- never re-derived or re-prompted.
3. On success: call RunIndexStore.mutate() to append `pr:<url>` (the returned { url }, prefixed) as a beadRefs[] entry -- beadRefs[] also holds plain bead IDs (e.g. "br-xxxx"), so the "pr:" prefix is the only way to tell a PR reference apart from a bead ID in that same array (artifacts[] itself only ever holds type "prd"/"trd" per TRD-001's fixed schema, so it can never carry this) -- and advance stage to "done" with stageOutcome { kind: "success", recordedAt: now() }.
4. On failure (createPullRequest() throws): call RunIndexStore.mutate() setting stageOutcome to { kind: "failure", detail: <error message>, recordedAt: now() } at the current stage (pr_create) -- do not advance stage, do not fabricate a PR URL. This is the same failure-pause/explicit-retry-only pattern Steps 3/4 above already define, applied to this stage.
