# ensemble-pr-merge

> **Mission:** Take an open pull request from red to merged with the minimum number of round-trips. Discovers every failing/pending CI check and every unresolved review change-request as a distinct finding, classifies each by root cause (implementation code, tests, build/CI pipeline, infrastructure/deployment, or PR mechanics), and dispatches one subagent per finding in parallel through the orchestrator that owns that domain: the tech-lead-orchestrator for implementation code, qa-orchestrator for test failures and test-related review comments, build-orchestrator for CI/build-pipeline checks, infrastructure-orchestrator for infra/deployment checks, and github-specialist for PR mechanics (conflicts, branch state, approvals, merge). Re-verifies against live CI/review state after every round -- never trusts a subagent's self-report -- and loops, bounded by --max-rounds, until every check is green and every review thread is resolved, then merges. Hard constraint: no finding may be resolved by deleting, skipping, or weakening a test; only real fixes to source, test, build, or config code count as resolution. Immediately before merging, distills every finding resolved this run into durable guardrails and appends them to the target repo's existing constitution (docs/standards/constitution.md, or .specify/memory/constitution.md when that is the only one present) -- never creates one -- so create-prd, create-trd, refine-prd, and future pr-merge runs are less likely to reproduce the same class of failure.

> **Constraints:**
> - NEVER delete, skip, xfail, disable, weaken an assertion in, or otherwise water down a test in order to make a CI check pass. Every dispatched subagent inherits this constraint verbatim in its payload. A failing test, compiler warning, or build failure MUST be fixed at its root cause in source or test code. If a test is genuinely obsolete because the behavior it covers was intentionally removed, the subagent MUST HALT that finding and escalate it in the round report for explicit human confirmation instead of deleting it unilaterally.
> - NEVER force-push over commits the assigned subagent did not itself author in this run, and NEVER bypass branch protection, required reviews, or required status checks to force a merge through.
> - NEVER merge while any required CI check is failing/pending or any review thread has CHANGES_REQUESTED outstanding. Only merge when gh pr view reports every required check SUCCESS and reviewDecision is APPROVED (or no review is required by branch protection).
> - Bound remediation to --max-rounds (default 5) verification rounds. Exceeding the bound is a HALT-and-escalate outcome, not a silent stop; the final report MUST list every still-open finding and its last known owner/orchestrator.
> - Each remediation round dispatches ALL findings from that round's manifest concurrently (one subagent per finding) and waits for every dispatch to settle before re-checking CI/review state -- never dispatch findings one at a time in serial.
> - A finding is only marked resolved after the fix is pushed to the PR branch AND the corresponding CI check/review thread is independently re-verified as passing/resolved in the next round's fresh gh pr checks / gh pr view read -- never trust a subagent's own self-report of success.
> - Constitution capture (Constitution Learning Capture phase) is best-effort and non-blocking: it MUST NEVER create docs/standards/constitution.md or .specify/memory/constitution.md if neither already exists in the target repo -- creating one is /ensemble-init-project's job, not pr-merge's -- MUST NEVER block, delay, or HALT the merge on its own failure, and MUST NEVER append a guardrail that duplicates or narrows existing constitution content.

## Phase 1: PR Discovery

### Step 1: Resolve Target PR

Resolve the PR to operate on and confirm it is actually mergeable-in-principle
before doing any remediation work.

**Actions:**
1. HALT if no matching PR is found, the PR is already MERGED/CLOSED, or isDraft is true (mark ready for review first, do not operate on drafts).
2. Record PR_NUMBER, PR_URL, HEAD_REF, BASE_REF for the rest of the run.

### Step 2: Baseline Findings Manifest

Build the round-0 Findings Manifest: one entry per failing/pending CI check, one
entry per unresolved review thread with a change request. This is the same manifest
shape reused at the top of every remediation round.

**Actions:**
1. Fetch checks: gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,state,bucket,workflow,link,description. Include every check whose state is FAILURE, ERROR, CANCELLED, TIMED_OUT, or PENDING (do not skip pending -- it must still be watched to a terminal state before merge).
2. Fetch review state: gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json reviews,reviewDecision,latestReviews. For reviewDecision == CHANGES_REQUESTED, fetch the actual unresolved review comment threads via gh api graphql (reviewThreads: isResolved:false) or gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{PR_NUMBER}/comments -- one Findings Manifest entry per distinct unresolved thread, not one entry for the whole review.
3. If zero failing/pending checks AND reviewDecision is not CHANGES_REQUESTED AND mergeable == MERGEABLE: skip directly to the Merge phase -- there is nothing to remediate.
4. Otherwise write the Findings Manifest as a numbered list: { finding_id, kind: check|review_thread, name, raw_log_excerpt_or_comment_body, link }.

## Phase 2: Classification and Routing

### Step 1: Classify Every Finding

Assign exactly one owning orchestrator per Findings Manifest entry using the fixed routing table below. Never leave a finding unrouted.

**Actions:**
1. ROUTING TABLE -- apply top to bottom, first match wins:
2. 1. Review thread or check log whose primary content is a missing/incorrect/insufficient test, a test coverage regression, a flaky test, or a reqnroll/BDD scenario gap -> qa-orchestrator.
3. 2. Check whose job name/workflow matches the repo's test runner (test.yml / *test* job) failing for a reason OTHER than the test itself being wrong (e.g. the code under test is broken) -> qa-orchestrator triages first; if qa-orchestrator's subagent determines root cause is implementation code, it re-routes by creating a follow-up finding for tech-lead-orchestrator in the next round rather than fixing production code itself.
4. 3. Check whose job name/workflow matches build/codegen/lint/typecheck/validate pipelines (validate.yml, codex-generate.yml, opencode-generate.yml, pi-generate.yml, or any compiler/build step) OR a review comment about implementation code correctness, architecture, or a compiler warning -> tech-lead-orchestrator (the development orchestrator for this plugin).
5. 4. Check whose job name/workflow is CI/CD pipeline infrastructure itself (artifact packaging, dependency resolution, matrix/build-system configuration unrelated to the PR's own code) -> build-orchestrator.
6. 5. Check or comment about cloud infrastructure, IaC, deployment, environment config, or monitoring -> infrastructure-orchestrator.
7. 6. Anything about merge conflicts, stale/out-of-date branch, missing required approvals, branch protection, commit message/conventional-commit format, or PR metadata (title, labels, linked issue) -> github-specialist.
8. Every finding gets exactly one ROUTE_AGENT. If a finding plausibly matches two rows, pick the first (topmost) match -- do not dual-route.

## Phase 3: Parallel Remediation Dispatch

### Step 1: Build Round Payloads

Construct one immutable remediation payload per Findings Manifest entry. The payload
is the entire brief the subagent receives -- it does not have this conversation's
history.

**Actions:**
1. Each payload MUST include: { PR_NUMBER, PR_URL, HEAD_REF, finding_id, kind, name, raw_log_excerpt_or_comment_body, link, round_number, hard_constraints (verbatim copy of this command's constraints: block, push_instructions: 'commit and git push to HEAD_REF directly; do not open a new PR' }.
2. hard_constraints in every payload MUST restate: never delete/skip/weaken a test to make it pass; fix failing tests, compiler warnings, and build failures for real; if a test looks obsolete, HALT and report instead of deleting it.

### Step 2: Concurrent Dispatch

Launch every finding's remediation subagent at once through its ROUTE_AGENT, without
waiting on any single one, then wait for the whole round to settle. This mirrors the
beads-build-wave.yaml concurrent-dispatch-then-barrier pattern.

**Actions:**
1. For each finding in the round, launch Task(subagent_type=<ROUTE_AGENT>, prompt=<remediation_payload>) WITHOUT waiting on any one. Start every finding's dispatch before waiting on any of them.
2. Barrier: wait for every dispatched subagent in the round to settle. One finding's subagent failing or hanging does NOT cancel or block its siblings' dispatches -- isolate failures per finding.
3. Each subagent is responsible for its own commit + push to HEAD_REF before it reports back; a subagent that reports success without a pushed commit is treated as still-open in the next round's re-verification (see constraints: never trust self-report).

## Phase 4: Verification and Round Loop

### Step 1: Re-Verify Against Live State

After a round's barrier settles, re-read CI/review state from scratch -- do not reuse
the pre-round manifest -- and rebuild the Findings Manifest exactly as in PR Discovery
step 2.

**Actions:**
1. Re-run: gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,state,bucket,workflow,link,description and gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json reviews,reviewDecision,latestReviews,mergeable,mergeStateStatus.
2. Diff against the round's dispatched findings: mark each as resolved (no longer failing/pending, or thread now resolved) or still-open (persists) or new (appeared only after this round's fixes -- e.g. a regression introduced by a fix).
3. If the manifest is now empty (zero failing/pending checks, no CHANGES_REQUESTED, mergeable == MERGEABLE): proceed to the Merge phase.
4. If findings remain and round_number < --max-rounds: increment round_number, re-classify the new manifest (Classification and Routing phase), and re-dispatch (Parallel Remediation Dispatch phase).
5. If findings remain and round_number == --max-rounds: HALT. Do not merge. Produce the final report (Reporting step) with every still-open finding, its last owning orchestrator, and its most recent log/comment state, and stop for human escalation.

## Phase 5: Constitution Learning Capture

### Step 1: Aggregate Guardrails and Update Constitution

Once the Findings Manifest is empty and merge is imminent, distill the findings
resolved across every round this run into zero or more durable, generalizable
guardrails and append them to the target repo's existing constitution, so the
same class of failure is less likely to recur on a future PR or a future
create-prd/create-trd/refine-prd run. This step never blocks or reverses a merge
decision -- any failure inside it is logged and swallowed, not escalated.

**Actions:**
1. Skip this entire phase when --dry-run is set, or when the Findings Manifest was empty at round 0 (nothing was actually remediated this run) -- there is nothing to learn.
2. Resolve the canonical constitution the same way create-prd/create-trd do: docs/standards/constitution.md when present, else .specify/memory/constitution.md, else skip this phase entirely and proceed straight to Merge and Report. This command NEVER creates a constitution file -- that is /ensemble-init-project's job, not pr-merge's.
3. For each finding resolved this run (across all rounds), classify it as PATTERN (a systemic, preventable mistake a future author or agent could plausibly repeat -- e.g. a test pinning an exact version/date string instead of an invariant, a stale text anchor left behind by a rename, a missing codegen step before commit, a previously-banned pattern reintroduced) or ONE-OFF (a unique bug or typo with no generalizable rule). Only PATTERN findings produce a candidate guardrail; ONE-OFF findings produce none.
4. For each PATTERN finding, draft exactly one guardrail: a short imperative rule plus a one-clause reason, stated as the general lesson -- never as a restatement of the specific bug or a reference to this PR/file (e.g. 'NEVER assert an exact version or date string in a test as proof a change shipped; assert the underlying invariant instead' rather than 'fix the version check in implement-trd-command.test.js').
5. Read the full canonical constitution before finalizing any draft. Drop any candidate guardrail whose rule is already covered, equaled, or subsumed by existing constitution content anywhere in the document -- never append a near-duplicate rule.
6. If zero guardrails survive classification and deduplication, stop here without touching the constitution file or creating a commit.
7. Otherwise append each surviving guardrail as a new numbered item under the constitution's non-negotiable-rules list inside its Core Principles section when that section and list exist in the recognizable init-project format; if the canonical constitution predates that structure (a migrated/legacy .specify constitution, or one hand-edited into an incompatible shape), append a new top-level `## CI/Review Remediation Guardrails` section instead rather than guessing at foreign structure. Add one Changelog row per guardrail using the constitution's existing Date/Change/Author table columns: `| <ISO date> | Guardrail: <one-line summary> | /ensemble-pr-merge (PR #<PR_NUMBER>) |`.
8. Commit the constitution update by itself, never bundled into a remediation subagent's commit, with message `docs(constitution): capture guardrail(s) from PR #<PR_NUMBER> remediation`, and push to HEAD_REF so it lands as part of this PR and is subject to the same CI/review as everything else in it.
9. After pushing, wait for this new commit's required checks to reach a terminal state (poll gh pr checks) before proceeding to Merge and Report -- treat this as a final verification pass, not a new remediation round; there are no findings to dispatch, only CI to wait out.
10. Any error in this phase (resolution, parse, write, or push failure) is non-fatal: log it once, do not retry, and proceed straight to Merge and Report -- a constitution-update failure must never HALT or block the merge.

## Phase 6: Merge and Report

### Step 1: Merge

Merge only once every required check is green and every review thread is resolved.

**Actions:**
1. Re-confirm immediately before merging (state can change between the last re-verify and now): gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision -- if mergeable != MERGEABLE or reviewDecision == CHANGES_REQUESTED, abort the merge and fall back to another Verification and Round Loop pass instead of forcing it.
2. If --dry-run was passed, stop here and report merge-readiness without merging.
3. Merge with gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> using this repo's configured default merge method (check branch protection / repo settings for squash vs merge vs rebase -- do not assume); delete the source branch on merge unless it is a long-lived branch.
4. Post a summary comment on the PR listing every finding that was remediated, which orchestrator owned it, and how many rounds it took.

### Step 2: Final Report

Emit a single machine-readable summary line as the last line of output.

**Actions:**
1. Schema (one line, valid JSON): { pr_number, pr_url, rounds_executed, findings_total, findings_resolved, findings_escalated, constitution_guardrails_added (number), merged (bool), halted_reason (string|null) }.
2. Print the JSON summary as the LAST line of stdout. Do not print further prose after it.
