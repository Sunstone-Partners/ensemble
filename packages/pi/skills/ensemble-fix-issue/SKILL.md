# ensemble-fix-issue

> **Mission:** Orchestrate a complete bug fix workflow from analysis to PR creation, assembling a virtual team of specialized agents (Product Manager, Tech Lead, Architect, QA Lead) to ensure high-quality fixes with minimal user intervention. Resumable and checkpointed (REQ-019): a run's stage and outcome are recorded via issue-run-index.ts after each of the 3 named phases, so a later invocation can resume, report status, or abandon it instead of re-deriving progress from conversation history. --foreman also carries an artifact contract: when FOREMAN_ARTIFACT_PATH is set and non-empty, write the phase report to that exact path (creating parent directories as needed) IN ADDITION TO any repo-local report this command already writes -- Foreman computes that path and reads it back to confirm the phase produced an artifact. Never invent, alter, or relocate the path, and never treat an unset FOREMAN_ARTIFACT_PATH as an error (outside Foreman dispatch it is simply absent and behavior is unchanged).

> **Constraints:**
> - GitHub only (no GitLab/Bitbucket in v1.0)
> - GitHub CLI (gh) must be installed and authenticated
> - Tests must pass unless --skip-tests flag is used
> - Maximum 2 auto-fix attempts for test failures
> - User interview limited to 5 questions maximum
> - Branch naming follows fixed convention (customizable via --branch)
> - When --foreman is set, the user interview step is force-skipped and PR creation always proceeds without pausing for confirmation
> - When --foreman is present and FOREMAN_ARTIFACT_PATH is set and non-empty, write the phase report to that exact path (creating parent directories as needed) IN ADDITION TO any repo-local report this command already writes -- Foreman computes that path and reads it back to confirm the phase produced an artifact. Never invent, alter, or relocate the path, and never treat an unset FOREMAN_ARTIFACT_PATH as an error (outside Foreman dispatch it is simply absent and behavior is unchanged).

## Arguments

- **`description`** (string, optional): Issue description (free text or omit if using --issue)
- **`issue`** (number, optional): GitHub issue number (e.g., --issue 34)
- **`branch`** (string, optional): Custom branch name (default auto-generated)
- **`skip-tests`** (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Skip test validation (not recommended)
- **`draft-pr`** (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Create draft PR instead of ready-for-review
- **`interactive`** (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Enable detailed user interviews during planning
- **`foreman`** (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Run in Foreman-native non-interactive mode -- skip the user interview step and always auto-commit + create the PR without pausing for confirmation (for automated Foreman orchestration). When --foreman is present and the FOREMAN_ARTIFACT_PATH environment variable is set and non-empty, write the phase report to that exact path (creating parent directories as needed) IN ADDITION TO any repo-local report this command already writes. Foreman computes that path and reads it back to confirm the phase produced an artifact; writing only to a repo-local convention leaves Foreman with no artifact. Never invent, alter, or relocate the path. Never treat an unset FOREMAN_ARTIFACT_PATH as an error — outside Foreman dispatch it is simply absent, and behavior must be unchanged.
- **`status`** (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Show the active/most-recent issue run's stage, outcome, and references without advancing it.
- **`abandon`** (boolean, optional, default: `false`): Abandon the project's active/paused issue run after explicit confirmation.

## Phase 1: Entry Point Resolution

### Step 1: Start New Run or Resume Active Run

A `description` or `issue` argument with no active run for
the project starts a fresh run at stage analysis_planning.
With neither argument (and no --status/--abandon), resume
the project's active/paused run from its last recorded
checkpoint.

### Step 2: --status -- Read-Only Run Report

Report the active/most-recent run's stage, outcome, and
references without advancing it. No stage executes and no
mutate() call is made regardless of what is found (AC-019-3).

### Step 3: --abandon -- Explicit Confirmation Required

Terminate the project's active/paused run after explicit
confirmation; the run reaches a terminal abandoned state
with its history retained (AC-019-4, AC-007-3).

## Phase 2: Analysis & Planning

### Step 1: Codebase Analysis

Explore codebase to identify affected files, patterns, and scope.
Use Grep, Glob, and Read tools to understand context.

### Step 2: Collaborative Planning

Assemble virtual team of 4 specialized agents to create comprehensive
fix plan with multiple perspectives.

### Step 3: User Interview (Conditional)

If issue description is ambiguous or --interactive flag is set,
ask clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME (max 5) -- never batch questions.
Use ask for each. Wait for each answer before asking the next.

### Step 4: Record Stage Checkpoint

Persist this phase's outcome and advance the run to the next
stage via issue-run-index.ts (Implementation AC 2, REQ-019).

## Phase 3: Execution

### Step 1: Branch Creation

Create git branch with conventional naming

### Step 2: Task List Generation

Break down plan into actionable tasks

### Step 3: Task Execution

Execute all tasks with appropriate agent delegation and
real-time progress tracking.

### Step 4: Record Stage Checkpoint

Persist this phase's outcome and advance the run to the next
stage via issue-run-index.ts (Implementation AC 2, REQ-019).

## Phase 4: Validation & Delivery

### Step 1: Test Validation

Run test suite with auto-fix retry logic. Ensure all tests
pass before creating PR.

### Step 2: PR Creation

Create comprehensive pull request with GitHub CLI

### Step 3: Record Stage Checkpoint

Persist this phase's outcome and mark the run complete via
issue-run-index.ts (Implementation AC 2, REQ-019).
