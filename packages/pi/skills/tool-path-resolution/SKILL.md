# Tool Path Resolution

Resolve the on-disk path of an internal monorepo tool (a Node.js CLI script or a
shell script) so commands work identically across every runtime this repo
ships to: the dogfooding monorepo checkout, a legacy CWD-relative install, a
Claude Code plugin install, and a Pi/OMP vendor bundle.

---

## Inputs

| Variable        | Type   | Description |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| `RELATIVE_PATH`  | string | Monorepo-root-relative path to the target file, e.g. `packages/development/lib/trd-cli.js` |
| `TARGET_VAR`     | string | Name of the variable the resolved path is stored in, e.g. `TRD_CLI` |

---

## Algorithm

Try each tier in order. The first path that exists on disk wins.

1. **Canonical monorepo root (dogfooding):**
   `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/<RELATIVE_PATH>`

2. **Legacy CWD-relative:**
   `<RELATIVE_PATH>` as-is (works when CWD is already the monorepo root).

3. **Claude Code plugin root:**
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/<RELATIVE_PATH with its packages/<pkg>/ prefix stripped>`

   Special case: the git-town validation script's plugin-root path is nested
   under `skills/git/git-town/scripts/validate-git-town.sh` — NOT
   `skills/git-town/...` — because `git` is a whole-directory symlink into the
   ensemble-git plugin.

4. **Pi/OMP vendor bundle:** resolve the `@sunstone-partners/ensemble-pi`
   package's own declared install location (do not hardcode `~/.omp/plugins`
   paths) via:

   ```bash
   node -e "try{console.log(require.resolve('@sunstone-partners/ensemble-pi/package.json',{paths:[process.env.ENSEMBLE_PI_INSTALL_ROOT, require('os').homedir()+'/.omp/plugins', process.cwd()].filter(Boolean)}))}catch(e){process.exit(1)}"
   ```

   Then join the directory of that output with:
   - `vendor/lib/<filename>` — for a `packages/development/lib/*.js` file
   - `vendor/scripts/<filename>` — for `validate-git-town.sh`
   - `skills/<skill-dir>/SKILL.md` — for another skill (skills are already
     Pi-published under `packages/pi/skills/` via the skill-copier mechanism —
     NOT vendored, unlike lib/scripts)

If none of the four tiers resolve (and, for Node-based tools, `which node`
fails), the calling command prints its own error message and HALTs/exits —
this skill defines the resolution *order* only. Each caller's error text and
follow-on behavior (smoke-checks, HALT wording, etc.) stays with the caller.

## Per-file cheat sheet

| Variable                | Relative path | Vendor bundle suffix |
|-------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| `TRD_CLI`               | `packages/development/lib/trd-cli.js` | `vendor/lib/trd-cli.js` |
| `TRD_GRAPH_CLI`         | `packages/development/lib/trd-graph-cli.js` | `vendor/lib/trd-graph-cli.js` |
| `PRD_CLI`               | `packages/development/lib/prd-cli.js` | `vendor/lib/prd-cli.js` |
| `VALIDATE_GIT_TOWN_SH`  | `packages/git/skills/git-town/scripts/validate-git-town.sh` | `vendor/scripts/validate-git-town.sh` |

`VALIDATE_GIT_TOWN_SH`'s Claude Code plugin root path is nested:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/git-town/scripts/validate-git-town.sh`.
