Refine and enhance an existing Product Requirements Document based on stakeholder
feedback, additional research, or identified gaps. Updates PRD while maintaining
version history, traceability, and alignment with the create-prd v2.2.0 format
including PRD Health summaries, MoSCoW priorities, and Implementation Readiness Gate
scoring.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Collaborative Review

**1. Session Bootstrap**
   HALT CHECK (run first, before the GUARD below or any other
bootstrap work): If $ARGUMENTS contains BOTH `--collab` and
`--foreman`, HALT immediately and print:
"ERROR: --collab requires a human reviewer and cannot be
combined with --foreman (non-interactive mode). Drop one of
the two flags." Do not resolve the PRD path, do not generate
questions, do not bootstrap a session, do not start a server.
This check runs even before the GUARD below.

GUARD: If BOTH `--collab` and `--long-lived` are absent from
$ARGUMENTS, skip this entire step and proceed directly to Phase 2
(PRD Review). Do not bootstrap a session, do not start a server,
do not block on an artifact. All other steps in this phase are
likewise skipped because the phase contains only this step.
Bootstrap a refinement-review session for collaborative editing of
the PRD, then wait for the reviewer to mark it complete in the
browser. The resulting artifact is the input to Enhancement.

1. Resolve the PRD path from $ARGUMENTS (first non-flag token).
2. Generate 5–10 refinement questions drawn from the PRD content.
   Each question MUST have this shape:
   ```js
   {
     id: 'q-<short-kebab>',
     prompt: '<multi-line question shown to reviewer>',
     context: '<why this question matters, cited from PRD>',
     targetAnchor: { lineStart: <1-based>, lineEnd: <1-based, inclusive> },
     options: [
       { id: '<option-kebab>', label: '<short verb phrase>',
         description: '<one-sentence clarification>' },
       // 2–5 total, mutually exclusive
     ],
     recommendedOptionId: '<one of the option ids>',
   }
   ```
   - For each `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker present, add a question
     whose `context` quotes the marker text verbatim.
   - Add a "top N gaps" question inferred from the PRD Health
     summary (MoSCoW coverage, missing ACs, missing REQ IDs).
   - `targetAnchor.lineStart`/`lineEnd` MUST point at the smallest
     line range in the PRD that the reviewer should focus on. For
     metadata-level questions (frontmatter author, version), use
     `{lineStart: 1, lineEnd: <first heading> + 1}`.
   - `options` is REQUIRED for collab. Provide 2–5 mutually
     exclusive options. Always include an option labeled
     "Skip — leave as-is" / "No — leave unchanged" as the last
     choice so the reviewer can opt out per question.
   - `recommendedOptionId` MUST be the `id` of the option you
     want to default-select. Always pick the option you would
     apply if the reviewer hit Save immediately.
3. Pick a session file path under a cache directory returned by
   `getLogsPath()` or equivalent (gitignored). The bootstrap script
   is generated outside the PI package's install directory, so plain
   `require('@sunstone-partners/ensemble-core')` will fail with
   `Cannot find module` — Node's caller-relative `node_modules`
   search does not walk back to the PI package's `node_modules`.
   **Anchor all package imports to the installed PI package's
   `package.json` via `createRequire`.** The bootstrap script
   resolves the PI package at runtime from well-known install
   locations (an explicit `ENSEMBLE_PI_INSTALL_ROOT` env var is
   honored for the packed-install test; the OMP plugin root and
   the current working directory are the production fallbacks):
   ```js
   const { createRequire } = require('module');
   const path = require('path');
   const os = require('os');
   const PI_PKG_JSON = require.resolve(
     '@sunstone-partners/ensemble-pi/package.json',
     {
       paths: [
         process.env.ENSEMBLE_PI_INSTALL_ROOT,
         path.join(os.homedir(), '.omp', 'plugins'),
         process.cwd(),
       ].filter(Boolean),
     },
   );
   const piRequire = createRequire(PI_PKG_JSON);
   Call
   `refinementReview.session.migrateOrCreate({ sessionPath, kind: 'prd', sourcePath, questions, reopen: true })`,
   where `migrateOrCreate` returns `{ session, token }` synchronously.
   It loads any prior session file at `sessionPath`; if the prior
   session was already completed (frozen by a prior `/api/complete`
   call), `reopen: true` clears `completedAt`/`completedBy` and
   bumps the revision so the iterative refinement loop can
   revisit the same sessionPath. User answers, comments, and
   `selectedOptionId` survive reopen. Without `reopen: true`,
   completed sessions throw `SESSION_COMPLETED` (preserving the
   prior guard behavior). It uses `mutateSession` to merge in
   new additive metadata (`options`, `recommendedOptionId`,
   missing `targetAnchor`) while preserving user-entered
   `answer`, `comments`, `selectedOptionId`, and revision
   history; falls back to `createSession` when no prior file
   is present.
4. Resolve the static UI directory by deriving it from the PI
   package's `node_modules` (where core actually resolves):
   ```js
   const corePkgJson = piRequire.resolve('@sunstone-partners/ensemble-core/package.json');
   const uiDir = path.join(path.dirname(corePkgJson), 'lib/refinement-review/ui');
   ```
   Compute the open intent once as
   `shouldOpen = !$ARGUMENTS.contains('--no-open') && process.env.CI !== 'true'`,
   and pass `open = shouldOpen && tunnel !== 'quick'` to
   `startServer`. Auto-open is deferred when `--tunnel=quick`
   is set because the opener should fire on the public URL
   (post-tunnel), not the local URL; the bootstrap fires the
   opener itself (using `shouldOpen`, not `open`) once
   `setTunnelUrl` has rewritten the review URL.
   **DO NOT gate on `process.stdout.isTTY`** — the bootstrap is
   typically launched from a process supervisor (hub, nohup,
   background shell) whose captured stdout is not a TTY, but the
   host GUI is fully functional. TTY is not a valid open-gate.
  The right opt-outs are `--no-open` and `CI=true`.
  **Long-lived mode (`--long-lived`):** before calling
  `startServer`, validate that `--reviewers` is NOT also
  present in $ARGUMENTS — the two modes are mutually
  exclusive and the bootstrap MUST abort with a clear
  error if both are supplied. Force `tunnel = 'quick'`
  regardless of any explicit `--tunnel` value (long-lived
  implies QuickTunnel). Parse `--ttl <duration>` (default
  `6h`); reject durations that parse to less than 6h with
  a clear error. Call `startServer({ sessionPath, token,
  uiDir, longLived: true, ttlMs: <ms>, port: 0, log,
  logError, open: false })`. `port: 0` lets the OS pick
  the actual port (the server result fills in `url`/
  `port`); `open: false` because the bootstrap fires the
  opener itself on the tunneled invite URL after step 5.
5. If `tunnel === 'quick'`: instantiate
   `new refinementReview.tunnel.QuickTunnel({ targetUrl: server.url })`,
   `await tunnel.start()`, then call
   `server.setTunnelUrl(tunnel.url)` which re-mints the share
   credential against the tunnel origin and rewrites
   `reviewUrl`/`publicUrl` on the server result. The minted
   field is `shareInvite` when `opts.longLived === true`
   and `shareNonce` otherwise; the URL shape is
   `<origin>/api/exchange?invite=<id>` for long-lived and
   `<origin>/api/exchange?nonce=<id>` for the default flow.
   Then (if `shouldOpen` is truthy) fire
   `refinementReview.opener.openUrl(tunneled.reviewUrl, {})`.
   The share URL never carries the bearer token. **Do not
   print the URL here** — step 6 owns the consolidated print
   so the listing reflects any mode-specific shape.
6. **If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--long-lived`:** skip the fan-out
   logic below entirely. After step 5 (tunnel setup),
   `server.reviewUrl` already carries the invite URL of the form
   `<origin>/api/exchange?invite=<id>`. Print the URL listing:
   `Local: <url>`, `Public: <publicUrl>`, `URL: <reviewUrl>`
   (same format as the tunnel+single-reviewer case). The invite
   is multi-use and any reviewer self-identifies through the
   form at `/api/exchange?invite=<id>`; there is no per-reviewer
   nonce to mint.
   Parse `--reviewers <N>` from $ARGUMENTS otherwise: extract
   `N` as a positive integer in `[1, 50]`.
   Default to `1` when
   the flag is absent. Validate strictly: a non-integer,
   a value `< 1`, or a value `> 50` MUST cause the
   bootstrap to abort with a clear error message rather
   than silently truncate to `1`. When `N > 1`, mint
   `(N - 1)` additional share URLs by calling
   `server.createShareUrl()` `N - 1` times — each call
   returns an independent `{ reviewUrl, shareNonce,
   publicUrl }` triple bound to the current public origin
   (tunnel origin when `--tunnel=quick`, local origin
   otherwise). Print the final URL listing to the user:
   - When `N === 1` (the default): print the original
     additive flow — `URL: <reviewUrl>` for the no-tunnel
     case, or `Local: <url>`, `Public: <publicUrl>`,
     `URL: <reviewUrl>` for the tunnel case. This format
     is preserved verbatim from the pre-fan-out behavior.
   - When `N > 1`: print `Local: <url>` and `Public:
     <publicUrl>` headers (tunnel case only) followed
     by `URL #1: <original reviewUrl>` through
     `URL #N: <(N-1)th createShareUrl().reviewUrl>`.
   Each reviewer redeems their own nonce independently
   through `/api/exchange`; the server burns the nonce
   atomically on first use, so a leaked `#k` URL cannot
   be replayed by a second reviewer, and all reviewers
   authenticate to the same session (same document, same
   answer set). The `--reviewers` flag is independent of
   `--tunnel`; both apply, and the fan-out URLs all share
   the same `publicUrl` (local origin when no tunnel,
   tunnel origin when `--tunnel=quick`).
7. **Run startServer in the foreground and `await` its
   `completed` promise** (returned alongside `url`, `port`,
   `reviewUrl`, `openResult`, and `stop`). This promise resolves
   with `{ artifactPath, session }` when the reviewer hits
   Complete in the UI — there is no need to poll or watch the
   artifact file. Do not background or detach the server: the
   bootstrap script must keep the request alive until the UI
   session ends so the next workflow step can continue
   automatically. Wrap the body in `try { ... } finally
   { await server.stop(); if (tunnel) await tunnel.stop(); }`
   so the HTTP listener and the cloudflared process are closed
   even if reading or recap throws — an open listener would
   keep the foreground Node process alive and block the
   workflow.
8. Once `completed` resolves, the artifact is already on disk at
   `artifactPath`. Read it and initialize `SELECTED_ITEMS` to the
   union of every question with `status === 'answered'` and every
   comment whose anchor is non-null. Map each comment to a finding
   against its anchor's section.
9. Print a session recap: answered count, comment count, artifact
   path. Carry `SELECTED_ITEMS` into the Enhancement phase. The
   PRD Review phase below will short-circuit on its Synthesis,
   Interview, and Feedback Integration steps.


### Phase 2: PRD Review

**1. Current PRD Analysis**
   Review existing PRD content and establish baseline metrics

   - Read the PRD file from the path provided in $ARGUMENTS
   - Parse frontmatter for Document ID, Version, Status, and Readiness Score
   - Count requirements by type (functional, non-functional) and priority (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
   - Count acceptance criteria and compute AC coverage percentage (requirements with at least one AC / total requirements)
   - Check if PRD Health summary exists and whether its numbers match actual requirement counts
   - Note the current version number for version bumping later

**2. Synthesis (skip when --collab or --long-lived in $ARGUMENTS)**
   If `--collab` or `--long-lived` is present in $ARGUMENTS, SKIP this
step entirely — the Collaborative Review phase has already collected
the findings and populated `SELECTED_ITEMS` from answered questions
and comments. Otherwise, perform the original synthesis below.
After reviewing the PRD, generate a numbered list of findings WITHOUT making
any edits yet. Scan for the following issues:

- '[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers from create-prd — present each one verbatim as a finding so the user''s answers replace the marker with actual content'
- Requirements missing REQ-NNN IDs as H3 headings
- Acceptance criteria that are missing or not in Given/When/Then format
- Missing PRD document ID (PRD-YYYY-NNN) in frontmatter
- Unclear or ambiguous requirement language
- Scope gaps (scenarios or edge cases not addressed)
- Goals and Non-Goals contradicted by a requirement's scope, priority, or existence (a requirement that a stated Non-Goal explicitly excludes, or that works against a stated Goal)
- Missing technical constraints or dependencies
- Missing priority ordering of features or requirements
- Open questions or unresolved decisions
- Requirements missing MoSCoW priority tags (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Requirements missing complexity tags (Low/Medium/High)
- Requirements missing risk indicators where complexity is Medium or High
- Missing or incomplete dependency map (cross-requirement dependencies)
- PRD Health summary missing or outdated (requirement counts by priority don't match actual counts)
- Missing Implementation Readiness Gate scorecard
- Acceptance criteria coverage gaps (Must requirements with fewer than 2 ACs, Should requirements with zero ACs)

IF `--foreman` is present in $ARGUMENTS: skip the AskUserQuestion
selection prompt below entirely. Instead, set SELECTED_ITEMS to
every finding number (equivalent to the user replying "all") and
print a log line: "Foreman mode: auto-applying N findings: <list>".
The Interview step (order 3) is also skipped under --foreman —
see its guard — so best-effort resolutions for each finding are
applied directly in Feedback Integration / Content Refinement,
reusing the `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <specific question>]` marker
convention for anything that cannot be safely resolved without
human input rather than leaving it silently unresolved.

Otherwise, use the AskUserQuestion tool to present a consolidated numbered list in this
exact format, then capture the user's selection as SELECTED_ITEMS:

---
Based on my review of <PRD filename>, here are the areas I suggest improving:

1. [issue description — e.g., "REQ-003 is missing acceptance criteria"]
2. [issue description]
...N. [issue description]

Which would you like to address? Reply with: all, a comma-separated list of
numbers (e.g. 1,3), or skip to exit without changes.
---

If the user replies "skip" or selects nothing, exit immediately without
making any changes. If the user replies "all", set SELECTED_ITEMS to every
finding number.


**3. Interview (skip when --collab or --long-lived in $ARGUMENTS)**
   If `--collab` or `--long-lived` is present in $ARGUMENTS, SKIP this
step entirely — the Collaborative Review phase already collected
interactive answers. If `--foreman` is present in $ARGUMENTS, ALSO
skip this step entirely — Synthesis already auto-selected every
finding. For each selected finding that would normally need a
follow-up question (unclear requirements, missing ACs, missing
REQ-NNN IDs, scope gaps, missing constraints, priority ordering,
MoSCoW/complexity/risk tags, dependency gaps), apply a
best-effort resolution directly instead of asking, and when no
safe default exists, insert an inline
`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <specific question>]` marker in place of
asking the question. Log a one-line summary of every
auto-applied finding before proceeding to Feedback Integration.
Otherwise, run the original interview below.
REQUIRED: Conduct a targeted user interview covering ONLY the topics
corresponding to SELECTED_ITEMS. Skip any findings the user did not select.

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to present questions interactively:
- Ask questions ONE AT A TIME (not all at once)
- Wait for user answer before asking the next question
- Do NOT just write questions in your response text
- The user should see interactive question UI prompts

'For [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] findings: quote the marker verbatim, then ask the embedded question directly. Replace the marker with the user''s answer in the Content Refinement step.'

For each selected finding, ask a focused follow-up question. Examples:
- For unclear requirements: ask the user to clarify intent or expected behavior
- For missing ACs: ask what testable conditions define success
- For missing REQ-NNN IDs: confirm the correct ID to assign
- For missing frontmatter: ask for the PRD document ID (PRD-YYYY-NNN)
- For scope gaps: ask whether the missing scenario should be in or out of scope
- For missing constraints: ask for the relevant technical or business constraints
- For priority ordering: ask the user to rank or confirm priority
- For missing MoSCoW tags: present the requirement and ask user to assign Must/Should/Could/Won't
- For missing complexity tags: ask user to assess Low/Medium/High based on implementation effort
- For missing risk indicators: ask what risks apply to Medium/High complexity items
- For dependency gaps: ask which requirements depend on or are blocked by others


**4. Feedback Integration (artifact when --collab or --long-lived in $ARGUMENTS)**
   If `--collab` or `--long-lived` is present in $ARGUMENTS, source the
answers and comments from the artifact written by the Collaborative
Review phase (path printed by that phase); the Interview step is
bypassed. If `--foreman` is present in $ARGUMENTS, source the
answers from the best-effort resolutions (and any inline
`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers) auto-applied during
Synthesis/Interview instead of live interview answers; the
Interview step is likewise bypassed. Otherwise, perform the
original feedback integration below.

Incorporate the answers gathered during the Interview step. Apply changes
only for SELECTED_ITEMS — do not modify sections the user did not select.


### Phase 3: Enhancement

**1. Content Refinement**
   Enhance clarity, detail, and completeness for SELECTED_ITEMS only.
Retroactively assign REQ-NNN IDs to any unnumbered requirements selected by the user.
Rewrite non-GWT acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format for selected items.
Add PRD frontmatter block if it was a selected finding (Document ID, Version, Status, Requirement count).
Add MoSCoW priority and complexity tags to requirements that were selected for tagging.
Add risk indicators to Medium/High complexity requirements that were selected.
Update or create the dependency map section if dependency gaps were selected.


**2. Validation**
   Verify structural integrity of all changes made during refinement

   - Verify all REQ-NNN IDs are unique and sequential (no duplicates, no gaps)
   - Verify all AC-NNN-M IDs are properly formatted and co-located under their parent requirements
   - Verify MoSCoW tags are present on all requirements touched during refinement
   - Verify Given/When/Then format on all acceptance criteria touched during refinement
   - Check that no requirements were accidentally removed during editing (compare count with baseline from Step 1.1)

### Phase 4: Readiness Gate Re-Score

**1. Readiness Assessment**
   Re-score the PRD after refinement to measure improvement

   - Check frontmatter for an existing Readiness Score from a previous create-prd or refine-prd run
   - If no previous score exists, inform the user: 'This PRD has no readiness score yet. Running the Implementation Readiness Gate for the first time.'
   - Score these 4 dimensions (1-5 scale): Completeness (are all feature areas covered?), Testability (does every Must/Should requirement have verifiable ACs?), Clarity (could two developers read this and build the same thing?), Feasibility (are all requirements achievable within stated constraints?)
   - Compute overall score: average of all 4 dimensions
   - If a previous score exists, print delta: 'Readiness score: X.X -> Y.Y (improved/declined)'
   - If the score dropped compared to previous, warn the user and identify which dimensions declined
   - Update the Readiness Score in the PRD frontmatter

### Phase 5: Output Management

**1. PRD Update**
   Save the refined PRD with updated metadata and changelog

   - Bump version in frontmatter (increment patch: e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1, 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4)
   - Preserve the Document ID and Label frontmatter fields unchanged -- never regenerate or renumber them on refine (downstream artifacts correlate by the micro UUID id)
   - Update the PRD Health summary: recalculate requirement counts by priority, AC coverage percentage, risk flag count, dependency count
   - Add changelog entry at the bottom of the PRD: date, version, list of changes made during this refinement
   - Save the updated PRD to the same file path (overwrite the original)
   - Print summary: number of changes made, new version, updated readiness score and delta (if applicable)

## Expected Output

**Format:** Refined Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Structure:**
- **Updated PRD**: Enhanced PRD with feedback incorporated and structural improvements
- **Updated PRD Health Summary**: Recalculated requirement counts by priority, AC coverage percentage, risk flags, and dependency count
- **Updated Readiness Scorecard**: Re-scored Implementation Readiness Gate with comparison to previous score (if applicable)
- **Version History**: Changelog entry documenting refinement date, version, and list of changes
